// Pack SERVER route module — Extension Host Phase-2 D2 litmus (the maximal pack).
//
// ESM (`export const routes`), loaded by the gateway RouteRegistry/RouteDispatcher
// and EXECUTED inside the confined worker. Pack server code is TRUSTED (the tool/MCP
// tier), so `node:child_process` + `node:fs` are ambient, `process.cwd()` is the
// SERVER-derived session working dir (worker threads can't `chdir`, so the bootstrap
// overrides `process.cwd` for tool parity), and any spawned `git` child is SIGKILLed
// on terminate-on-timeout (resource isolation). The git working dir is server-derived
// from the bound session, never caller-supplied.
//
// ── LIVE CHANGESET RECOMPUTE (design §D2.3 — the reversal of the prior revision) ──
// The bespoke route `src/server/pr-walkthrough/routes.ts` COMPUTES the changeset
// bundle at request time: it shells out to `git` (execFile), parses the unified
// diff, assembles the changeset header, and runs LLM card synthesis. This pack route
// re-expresses the STRUCTURAL part of that LIVE in the confined worker — the SAME
// `git diff`/`--name-status`/`--shortstat` + diff parse + `synthesizeFallbackCards`
// logic — so `bundle` returns a REAL, freshly-computed changeset for the requested
// base/head, including PRs created AFTER the pack was installed (a static seeded
// fixture could only replay PRs known at publish time).
//
// ── THE GIT WORKING DIR IS SERVER-DERIVED, NEVER CALLER-SUPPLIED (security) ──
// The repo root is ALWAYS the worker's own `process.cwd()` — i.e. the bound
// session's working dir, server-resolved from the persisted session. This module
// does NOT accept a caller-controlled `repoDir` (from query, body, or store) as the
// git cwd: a session scoped to this pack must not be able to point the route at
// ANOTHER local repo the gateway can reach (that would disclose diffs/metadata from
// other projects and bypass session-working-dir confinement). The caller chooses
// WHICH base/head to diff; the SERVER chooses WHICH repo (the session worktree).
//
// ── THE SYNTHESIS SPLIT (design §D2.3) ──
// LLM card synthesis needs MODEL CREDENTIALS + an agent loop. Rather than re-derive
// that inference inside this route, this pack keeps synthesis at agent-tool/submit
// time (where the agent already has its model creds) and has the route serve the
// persisted result. So LLM synthesis does NOT run in this route. The split:
//   • The STRUCTURAL changeset + deterministic fallback cards are COMPUTED LIVE
//     here (git).
//   • LLM-ENHANCED cards are produced at AGENT-TOOL/submit time
//     (`submit_pr_walkthrough_yaml`, normal agent creds, NOT this worker) and
//     PERSISTED via the `publish` route to `host.store`, keyed by the changeset id.
//   • This `bundle` route, when the computed changeset id HAS stored cards, READS
//     them via `host.store.get` and renders them (full parity); when none exist it
//     returns the correct non-LLM (fallback) walkthrough it just computed.
// `host.store.*` is pack-scoped server-side by the SERVER-derived packId (cross-pack
// reads rejected) — so this module never names a packId or a path.
