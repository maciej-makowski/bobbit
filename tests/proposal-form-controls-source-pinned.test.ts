/**
 * Source-pin test for the goal-proposal modal subgoal controls.
 *
 * `renderGoalForm` in `src/app/proposal-panels.ts` renders two per-goal controls in
 * the proposal modal when `config.subgoalsEnabled` is true:
 *   - the "Allow subgoals" checkbox (data-testid="goal-form-subgoals-toggle")
 *   - the "Max depth" number input  (data-testid="goal-form-max-depth")
 *
 * Both controls shipped originally in commit 492d88e1 and were silently
 * dropped during a later merge-conflict resolution — operators lost the
 * ability to disable subgoal spawning per-goal or tighten the nesting cap
 * at creation time. The regression went unnoticed because nothing pinned
 * the controls' presence in the rendered form.
 *
 * This is a SOURCE-PIN: we read proposal-panels.ts as text and assert the two
 * test-id strings exist. It mirrors `tests/server-subgoals-getter-wired.test.ts`.
 * The bug-class is "the UI element disappeared from the form during a
 * merge" — a behavioural assertion would still pass when the controls
 * have been silently dropped because the surrounding form code is intact.
 *
 * Runtime behaviour (toggle, clamp, submission wiring, server persistence)
 * is independently pinned by:
 *   - tests/e2e/ui/goal-proposal-form.spec.ts (browser E2E + REST round-trip)
