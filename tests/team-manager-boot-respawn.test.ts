/**
 * Reproducing test for boot-time team respawn creating a new lead for an
 * intentionally sessionless goal.
 *
 * Bug: TeamManager.resubscribeTeamEvents() runs during gateway boot and calls
 * the private _bootRespawnSessionlessGoals() helper. That helper scans every
 * in-progress ready team goal that has no restored team entry and calls
 * startTeam(goalId), creating a new team lead after restart. Goals that were
 * deliberately left teamless (autoStartTeam:false or after teardownTeam) should
 * remain teamless until the user clicks Start Team.
