/**
 * Phase 3 / paused-children-not-in-flight rule — A paused child must NOT short-circuit the wait
 * loop. Paused != failed; the child can resume on user/parent action.
 *
 * Concretely: while `child.paused === true && child.archived === false`,
 * the harness keeps polling. Only an external archive (success terminal or
 * shelved-dupe) or `active.cancelled` exits the wait.
 *
 * This test exercises the real polling loop with a real GoalStore, swapping
 * the goal's `paused` flag mid-wait and then flipping it to "ready-to-merge
 * passed" to verify the wait completes only after the gate passes.
