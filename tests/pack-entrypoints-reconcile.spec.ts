/**
 * Unit tests for the client pack-entrypoint registry — launcher surfaces +
 * deep-linkable client routes + `host.ui.navigate` resolution (pack schema V1
 * §8.2; design pack-schema-v1-rationalisation.md). Pins the generation-guarded,
 * project-scoped, reload-safe registry (the entrypoint analogue of
 * pack-renderers/pack-panels-reconcile.spec.ts), using a THIRD-PARTY pack fixture
 * (not the litmus packs) so the surface is proven reusable, not hardcoded:
 *   - reconcile re-drives registration scoped to the active project (from
 *     /api/ext/contributions, NOT /api/tools); dedupes;
 *   - `navigate(RouteTarget)` maps a STRUCTURED target → #/ext/<routeId>?<params>
 *     (params filtered to declared paramKeys; the pack never bakes a hash string);
 *   - getRouteFromHash parses #/ext/<routeId> back to a structured ext route;
 *   - reload restoration: a deep-link → lookupPackRoute → openPackPanel (serves
 *     the pack-addressed bearer-only /panels/ endpoint);
 *   - uninstall reconcile drops the route + launchers (a later navigate no-ops);
 *   - duplicate routeId across packs is rejected (lookupPackRoute undefined);
 *   - NO auto-invoke on mount (reconcile alone touches no panel endpoint + no hash).
 *
 * Pattern mirrors pack-panels-reconcile.spec.ts: esbuild bundles the entry once, a
 * file:// fixture loads it, helpers are driven via window globals; window.fetch is
 * stubbed to record request URLs + serve fake metadata + a fake panel module.
