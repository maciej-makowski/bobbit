/**
 * Phase 3 / stale-pointer invalidation — A cached `childGoalId` that points at an archived
 * non-complete child is a dead pointer. The harness MUST wipe the pointer
 * (and persist the wipe via `_persistActive`) before falling through to
 * spawn a fresh child.
 *
 * Without this, every subsequent `gate_signal execution` runs the wait loop
 * forever — the dupe is archived, no progress, but the existing
 * `archived && state === "complete"` short-circuit doesn't fire (state is
 * shelved, not complete).
