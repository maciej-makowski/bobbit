/**
 * Unit tests for `reconcilePackPanelsForProject` + `openPackPanel`'s lazy panel
 * loader URL (pack schema V1 §8.1 — pack-scoped panels keyed by {packId, panelId}
 * + `host.ui.openPanel`; design pack-schema-v1-rationalisation.md). Pins the
 * generation-guarded, project-scoped, reload-safe pack-panel registry — the panel
 * analogue of pack-renderers-reconcile.spec.ts:
 *   - reconcile re-drives registration scoped to the active project (from
 *     /api/ext/contributions, NOT /api/tools); dedupes unchanged; swaps the panel
 *     loader's project scope on a project change;
 *   - an out-of-order late reconcile(A) response does NOT clobber B's registry;
 *   - an uninstall reconcile (empty packs) drops the panel so a later open
 *     no-ops (reconcile-on-uninstall, generation-guarded — no stale apply);
 *   - the loader serves the pack-addressed bearer-only
 *     GET /api/ext/packs/:packId/panels/:panelId endpoint via the host toolkit
 *     factory (no bare lit import).
 *
 * Pattern mirrors pack-renderers-reconcile.spec.ts: esbuild bundles the entry
 * once, a file:// fixture loads it, and we drive the helpers via window globals.
 * `window.fetch` is stubbed to record request URLs + serve fake metadata + a
 * fake panel module.
