/**
 * Regression: the rAF eye-animation loop must NOT call getAnimations() every
 * frame.
 *
 * readPhasePct() observes the CSS animation clock by finding the cycle-duration
 * Animation on the canvas. getAnimations() enumerates + allocates an array of
 * every Animation on the element, and was being called once per requestAnimation
 * Frame per sprite — a measurable renderer hotspot (~8.5% CPU under sidebar
 * churn). The target Animation is a persistent object, so it must be resolved
 * once and cached, then reused across frames (reading .currentTime live each
 * frame). This spec lets the loop run many frames and asserts getAnimations()
 * is called only a small constant number of times, NOT once per frame.
