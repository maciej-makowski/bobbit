// Test entry — exercises `reconcilePackPanelsForProject` + `registerPackPanels`
// + `openPackPanel` (pack schema V1 §8.1; design
// docs/design/pack-schema-v1-rationalisation.md). Mirrors
// pack-renderers-reconcile-entry.ts: stub `window.fetch` to record every request
// URL and serve fake /api/ext/contributions metadata + a fake panel module, then
// drive the pack-panel reconcile/registration/open via window-exposed helpers
// under a file:// fixture. Pins:
//   1. reconcile fetches /api/ext/contributions scoped to the project id.
//   2. a redundant reconcile for the SAME project is deduped (no re-fetch).
//   3. openPackPanel's lazy loader serves the pack-addressed
//      /api/ext/packs/:packId/panels/:panelId endpoint scoped to the CURRENT
//      project id.
//   4. a reconcile for a NEW project re-drives + swaps the loader's project scope.
//   5. out-of-order completion does not clobber the newer project's registry.
//   6. uninstall reconcile drops the panel — a later openPackPanel no-ops.
