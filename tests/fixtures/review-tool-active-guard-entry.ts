// Test entry — bundles RemoteAgent for the review-tool active-guard fixture.
//
// Regression coverage: when an agent in a *background/cached* session emits a
// `review_open` (or `review_close`) tool result, its `_checkReviewToolResult`
// must NOT mutate the globally-shared `state.review*` fields (which would
// land on whichever session the user is currently viewing).
//
// We can't easily construct a real connected RemoteAgent in a file:// fixture,
// so we instantiate two and drive `_checkReviewToolResult` directly with
// synthetic tool-result messages. `state.selectedSessionId` is the canonical
// "active session" pointer (set synchronously in selectSession before any
// agent connects) — the production code under test must consult it before
// mutating global review state.
