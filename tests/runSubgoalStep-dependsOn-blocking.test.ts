/**
 * dependsOn scheduling enforcement on the parent-workflow subgoal path.
 *
 * Spec: "Full DAG dependencies: declare `dependsOn` between sibling sub-goals;
 * a child with unmet deps is created paused/blocked and auto-resumes when its
 * last dependency merges" and "The `subgoal` verify-step type IS the
 * scheduler." The direct `goal_spawn_child` REST path already blocks on unmet
 * deps (creates `state:"blocked"`, auto-unblocked by integrate-child); this
 * suite pins the equivalent behaviour on `runSubgoalStep` (the `parent`
 * meta-workflow execution path):
 *
 *   - A sibling step with an unmet `dependsOn` is created `state:"blocked"`
 *     and its team/worktree is NOT started.
 *   - Two sibling steps with an A→B dependency do NOT run concurrently:
 *     B's team only starts after A merges (harness auto-unblock scan).
 *   - When all of a step's deps are already merged, it spawns immediately
 *     (never blocked).
