/**
 * Source-pin tests for known silent merge-loss regressions.
 *
 * Each test here pins a single load-bearing symbol or substring that has
 * previously vanished from the codebase via silent merge-conflict
 * resolution. The pins are deliberately blunt — they read the owning file
 * as text and assert a unique substring exists. A behavioural unit test
 * would not catch the bug class because the surrounding code is intact;
 * only the wiring is dropped.
 *
 * If one of these tests fails: DO NOT delete the test. The fix is to
 * restore the dropped block from the referenced restoration commit and
 * keep the pin in place. Each pin includes the original-add commit and
 * the most recent restoration commit so future agents can see how many
 * times the same hunk has been silently dropped.
 *
 * See docs/audit/silent-merge-loss-2026-05-15.md for the full audit.

	// fallback (d4be2150)" silently dropped the entire inline-workflow +
	// inline-roles editor surface from src/app/render.ts. The pre-merge
	// parent (46e21256^1) had 13 references to `inlineWorkflowYaml` and 11
	// to `inlineRolesYaml`; the merge result has zero of either. The merge
	// took the trunk side of render.ts wholesale (-617 net lines) without
	// preserving the proposal-modal customisation surface.
	//
	// The replacement landed by this proposal-modal-tabs fix is NOT the old
	// YAML <details>+textarea UX — it is a tabbed surface that reuses the
	// main Workflows/Roles page renderers (see
	// docs/audit/silent-merge-loss-2026-05-15.md and the gated design doc).
	// The pins below assert the *new* user-facing surface exists; deleting
	// them or weakening them to allow the old YAML textareas is a hard fail.
