/**
 * Plan tab — archived/completed children inclusion.
 *
 * Pins the contract that the Plan-tab data layer
 * (`computePlanStepsForGoal`) and the descendant-walk helper
 * (`collectDescendants`) BOTH include archived and completed children
 * by default. The historical bug (subgoals cb75426e / 4581f8a5) flipped
 * a filter from "all" to "live only" so dozens of merged/archived
 * children silently vanished from the Plan tab.
 *
 * Cases:
 *  - default includes archived
 *  - default includes complete
 *  - liveOnly:true excludes archived
 *  - liveOnly:true keeps live in-progress / blocked
 *  - collectDescendants includes archived descendants
 *
 * Every assertion uses the word `archived` in the case name so
 * future agents can grep `archived` and locate the contract.
