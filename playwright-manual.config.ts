 * Manual integration test config.

 * These tests use real agents (not mocks) and real Docker containers.
 * They are NOT included in `npm test`, `npm run test:unit`, or `npm run test:e2e`.
 *
 * Everything under `tests/manual-integration/` is collected by the single
 * `manual-integration` project below. This is the ONLY gate-exempt path — the
 * real-LLM compaction spec and the real-Docker sandbox-recovery spec physically
 * live here (not under `tests/e2e/` with an ignore) so the phase-invariant
 * guard can treat the exempt set as exactly `tests/manual-integration/**`.
 *
 * Run:  npm run test:manual
