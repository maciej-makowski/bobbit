# Workflow Authoring Guide

> **Audience:** the project assistant and goal assistant when generating or editing the inline `workflows:` block of a project's `project.yaml`.
>
> This guide is **not read at runtime**. It is included as context for assistant prompts so that hand-generated workflows are consistent and runnable. The runtime contract lives in `src/server/agent/workflow-validator.ts` and the gate runner; this document mirrors it.

## 1. Project model

A project is registered by its `name` and a `rootPath`. Inside `<rootPath>/.bobbit/config/project.yaml` we store:

```yaml
name: <project name>
worktree_root: <optional override>
sandbox: none | docker
sandbox_image: bobbit-agent
sandbox_tokens: [...]               # project-level
config_directories: [...]           # project-level

components:                         # the only collection
  - name: web
    repo: "."
    commands: { build: npm run build, test: npm test }
    config:                         # opaque key→string map; consumed by skills like /qa-test
      qa_start_command:        "PORT=$PORT NODE_ENV=test npm start"
      qa_health_check:         "http://127.0.0.1:$PORT/api/health"
      qa_browser_entry:        "http://127.0.0.1:$PORT/?token=$TOKEN"
      qa_max_duration_minutes: "10"
      qa_max_scenarios:        "5"

workflows: { id: WorkflowDef, ... } # bespoke, inline
```

The **multi-repo invariant**: every component points at exactly one repo (or `"."` for single-repo). When a goal/session/staff worktree is provisioned, the agent gets a sibling worktree of every distinct repo at the same branch. Cross-repo work is expressed by declaring all the repos as components — *data-only* if they have no commands of their own.

### Single-repo vs multi-repo

| | Single-repo | Multi-repo |
|---|---|---|
| `rootPath` | the git repo | a container directory holding sibling repos |
| `components[*].repo` | always `"."` | folder name relative to `rootPath` |
| Worktree layout | `<wt-root>/<branchSlug>/` is the repo | `<wt-root>/<branchSlug>/<repo>/` per-repo |

Mode is inferred: any component with `repo !== "."` makes the project multi-repo.

## 2. Component model

```yaml
components:
  - name: api                     # unique within project; used as branch-dir label
    repo: "."                     # "." for single-repo, else a subfolder of rootPath
    relative_path: packages/api   # optional sub-path inside the repo
    worktree_setup_command: npm ci --prefer-offline --no-audit --no-fund
    commands:                     # flat name → shell map
      build:    npm run build
      test:     npm test
      check:    npm run check
      unit:     npm run test:unit
      e2e:      npx playwright test
      lint:     eslint .
      migrate:  npm run db:migrate
```

- **`name`** must match `[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*` and be unique. The default component for a single-repo project is named after the project (NOT `default`).
- **`repo`** is `"."` for single-repo. For multi-repo, it must be a single folder name one level deep under `rootPath` (no slashes, no `..`).
- **`relative_path`** is an optional sub-path inside the repo's worktree. Useful for monorepos: `repo: "."` and `relative_path: packages/api` means commands run at `<branch-container>/packages/api`.
- **`worktree_setup_command`** is a per-component runtime hook. Runs at the component's root path on worktree provision. 2-minute timeout, non-fatal, no deduplication.
- **`commands`** is a free-form map. There is no fixed schema for command names — workflows reference commands structurally by `(component, command)` pair. Common conventions: `build`, `check`, `test`, `unit`, `e2e`, `lint`, `format`, `migrate`. Use whatever your project actually has.

### Data-only components

A component without a `commands` map (or with an empty one) is **data-only**: it declares the existence of a repo but contributes no workflow steps. Use cases:

- Vendor / fixtures / shared assets repo that must be checked out alongside others.
- An e2e harness that lives in one component (`repo: e2e`) and shells into sibling worktrees of `api`, `web`, `shared`. Declare `api`/`web`/`shared` as data-only if they don't build/test in their own right.

Data-only components participate in worktree provisioning (they are checked out on the goal/session branch) but generate zero workflow steps automatically — and the validator never tries to resolve a `(component, command)` reference against them.

### Component working directory

The "component root" is the absolute path where its commands run:

```
componentRoot = <branch-container> / (component.repo === "." ? "" : component.repo) / (component.relative_path ?? "")
```

In single-repo, `<branch-container>` *is* the repo's worktree, so `componentRoot` collapses to `<branch-container>` (with optional `relative_path` appended). In multi-repo, the branch container is a sibling-repo container directory.

### Monorepo subprojects

A **monorepo** is one git repo at `rootPath` containing multiple workspace packages (pnpm/npm/yarn workspaces, Nx, Turbo, Lerna, Cargo workspace, Go workspace, Gradle multi-module). Model each workspace package as its own component, all sharing `repo: "."` with distinct `relative_path` values. The project-assistant scaffolding scan auto-detects these manifests and feeds candidate package paths into the assistant's prompt.

Key rules:

- Every component has `repo: "."` (one git repo for all of them).
- `relative_path` is the workspace package's path inside the repo (e.g. `packages/api`, `apps/web`, `crates/server`).
- The component `name` is a slugified version of the package name (`@acme/api` → `api`).
- `commands` invoke the workspace tool with the package selector — **not** raw `npm run build` from the package directory, because most workspace tools need to be invoked from the repo root with a filter so they pick up shared dependencies and incremental caches.
- A `worktree_setup_command` is typically only needed once at the root (e.g. `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`); set it on a single component rather than duplicating across every package.

```yaml
# pnpm workspace example: 3 components, all repo: ".", distinct relative_path.
components:
  - name: api
    repo: "."
    relative_path: packages/api
    worktree_setup_command: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile --prefer-offline
    commands:
      build: pnpm --filter @acme/api build
      test:  pnpm --filter @acme/api test
      check: pnpm --filter @acme/api check
  - name: web
    repo: "."
    relative_path: apps/web
    commands:
      build: pnpm --filter @acme/web build
      test:  pnpm --filter @acme/web test
      e2e:   pnpm --filter @acme/web exec playwright test
  - name: shared
    repo: "."
    relative_path: packages/shared
    commands:
      build: pnpm --filter @acme/shared build
      test:  pnpm --filter @acme/shared test
```

For a monorepo like this, the per-component and all-components fan-out scaffolds are often the right starting point — the assistant should consider them explicitly and recommend them when they fit, but they are not pre-checked by component count. The assistant must justify each workflow it proposes against the project's actual components and commands.

## 3. Workflow gates

```yaml
workflows:
  general:
    name: General
    description: Lightweight workflow for general-purpose goals.
    gates:
      - id: design-doc
        name: Design Document
        content: true              # gate accepts markdown content as a signal
        inject_downstream: true    # content is propagated to downstream gates' prompts
        verify:                    # array of verification steps
          - { name: "Design review", type: llm-review, role: architect, prompt: "..." }

      - id: implementation
        name: Implementation
        depends_on: [design-doc]
        verify: [...]

      - id: ready-to-merge
        name: Ready to Merge
        depends_on: [implementation]
        manual: true               # user must click "Mark passed" once deps are met
```

### Gate fields

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | unique within workflow; lowercase, alphanumeric + hyphens |
| `name` | string | display name |
| `description` | string? | optional narrative |
| `depends_on` | string[] | upstream gate IDs (must exist; no cycles) |
| `content` | boolean? | accepts markdown content via `gate_signal` |
| `inject_downstream` | boolean? | propagate content to downstream gate prompts |
| `optional` | boolean? | gate may be signaled with N/A |
| `manual` | boolean? | user must explicitly mark passed (no automatic verify) |
| `metadata` | map? | declared metadata schema for signals; values resolved via `{{agent.X}}`/`{{<gate>.meta.X}}` |
| `verify` | VerifyStep[] | verification steps (see §4) |

### Producers vs verifiers

Roles listed under a gate's `verify:` block (e.g. `role: architect`, `role: code-reviewer`, `role: spec-auditor`, `role: security-reviewer`, `role: reviewer`) are **verifiers** — the gate runner spawns them automatically after the gate is signaled, and they critique the signaled content. They are **not producers** of the gate's content.

The team lead is the producer for content gates: it either drafts the markdown directly and signals, or delegates artifact-writing to a `coder` / `docs-writer`, merges the resulting branch, and signals from the merged content. Every contributor role carries `gate_signal: never` in its tool-policy; only the `team-lead` role's policy permits the call. Workflow authors should therefore not staff content-producing tasks with reviewer roles, and should expect the team lead — never the reviewer named under `verify:` — to be the one calling `gate_signal`.

### 3.1 The implementation gate is a Ralph loop

The `implementation` gate's `verify` list is the agent's loop body. When verification
fails, the gate runner reports the failed steps to the implementing agent, which
fixes the code and re-signals the gate. The agent circles back through the same
verify list until it passes — this is the **Ralph loop**.

Practical implications when authoring workflows:

- **Verify steps must be self-contained checks**, not setup actions. The agent
  re-runs all of them on each iteration; a step that mutates external state
  (publishes a package, opens a PR) belongs in `ready-to-merge`, not `implementation`.
- **Phase your steps so cheap signals fail fast**: phase 0 = build, phase 1 = parallel
  test/check, phase 2 = expensive LLM reviews, phase 3 = optional QA. The runner
  short-circuits later phases when an earlier phase fails, so the Ralph loop spends
  its iterations on the cheapest signal that's still red.
- **Always include a gap-analysis step at design-time AND post-implementation**
  (except quick-fix). Design-time gap analysis catches missing requirements before
  the agent burns iterations; post-impl gap analysis catches drift between design
  and code. The `general`, `feature`, and per-component templates in this guide include both — use them as starting points when they fit the project.
  **Post-impl gap analysis must explicitly tell the reviewer to ignore documentation
  gaps** — it runs in the `implementation` gate, before the dedicated `documentation`
  gate, so flagging missing/stale docs there causes redundant Ralph-loop iterations.
  Focus the prompt on code/behavior gaps relative to the spec and design.
- **The `description` field on the gate** surfaces in the project-proposal panel
  and the goal dashboard. Use it to remind reviewers that this gate is a loop, not
  a checkpoint.

## 4. Verification step shapes

There are four step `type:` values: `command`, `llm-review`, `agent-qa`, `human-signoff`.

### 4.1 `type: command` — three shapes

```yaml
# Shape A: structural — named command on a component (preferred)
- { name: "Build api", type: command, component: "api", command: "build" }

# Shape B: free-form shell, working dir derived from component
- { name: "Custom api thing", type: command, component: "api", run: "./scripts/special.sh" }

# Shape C: pure free-form, working dir = per-branch container root
- { name: "Push branch", type: command, run: "git push origin {{branch}}:refs/heads/{{branch}} && git ls-remote --heads origin {{branch}} | grep -q ." }
```

Use an explicit destination refspec for branch publication. Do **not** use a
branch-only `git push` command: inherited upstream config and
`push.default=upstream` can redirect it to the base/primary branch. The
verification runner rejects unsafe bare pushes and direct updates to protected
base branches before executing command steps.

Validator rules:

- Cannot have both `command:` and `run:` on the same step.
- Cannot have neither (a `type: command` step must produce a runnable shell string).
- A `command:` reference must resolve to `components[name].commands[name]` — unknown components or unknown command keys are a hard load-time error with a "Did you mean…" suggestion.
- Pure `{ run }` steps without `component:` run at the per-branch container root.

Common optional fields (apply to all three shapes):

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `phase: <int>` | groups parallel-runnable steps; phases run in ascending order |
| `expect: success \| failure` | flips pass/fail (use `failure` for TDD reproducing-tests) |
| `timeout: <seconds>` | per-step timeout (default 300s) |
| `optional: true` + `optionalLabel:` + `description:` | renders as a user-toggleable "Enable X" affordance |

> **Field split.** `optionalLabel:` is the goal-creation opt-in toggle
> label for any `optional: true` step. `label:` is reserved exclusively
> for the sign-off card title on `type: human-signoff` steps. Older YAML
> that overloaded `label:` for the opt-in toggle on non-human-signoff
> steps is migrated forward by the workflow loader and rewritten in canonical
> shape on next save. See `docs/goals-workflows-tasks.md` for durable details.

### 4.2 `type: llm-review`

Reviewer agent. Runs against the diff between the goal's branch and master, with access to repo files and gate content.

```yaml
- name: "Code quality review"
  type: llm-review
  role: code-reviewer       # any registered role; default if omitted
  phase: 2
  prompt: |
    Review the code changes on branch {{branch}} vs origin/{{baseBranch}} for quality.
```

### 4.3 `type: agent-qa`

QA agent. Stands up the owning component's `config.qa_start_command` testbed (as identified by the step's `component:` field) and drives a real browser through scenarios. Requires that at least one component carries `config.qa_start_command` — the validator warns (does not reject) if missing.

```yaml
- name: "QA testing"
  type: agent-qa
  role: qa-tester
  component: web                   # which component's config.qa_start_command testbed to start
  phase: 3
  optional: true
  optionalLabel: Enable QA Testing
  description: Spawn a QA agent that builds, starts the server, and drives a real browser through scenarios.
  prompt: |
    Stand up the ephemeral testbed (the owning component's `config.qa_start_command`),
    plan 3-5 scenarios, drive the browser, submit `verification_result`.
```

### 4.4 `type: human-signoff`

Parks the gate on a deferred resolver until a human approves or rejects via the chat-header `<goal-status-widget>`. Reuses the async-verification machinery from `llm-review` / `agent-qa` — restart-safe, cancellable on re-signal, and emits the same `{ passed, output, artifact }` shape every other step produces.

```yaml
- name: design-approval
  type: human-signoff
  phase: 1
  label: "Approve design doc"
  prompt: |
    Review the design doc for {{branch}} and approve or reject.
    Pay attention to the cancellation semantics in §3.
```

Required: `label` (non-empty) and `prompt` (non-empty). The validator rejects the step on load otherwise. `{{branch}}`, `{{baseBranch}}` (and the legacy alias `{{master}}`), `{{goal_spec}}`, and `{{<gate>.meta.<key>}}` are substituted before the prompt is shown to the user.

Behavior contract:

- **No timeout.** The step waits indefinitely. Cancel via the dashboard's `Cancel verification` button if a request becomes irrelevant.
- **Authz (v1).** Trusts the gateway token — anyone with UI access can sign off. Sandboxed sub-agents are blocked at the `sandbox-guard` layer so they cannot self-approve their own gating step.
- **Test bypass.** Only `BOBBIT_HUMAN_SIGNOFF_SKIP=1` auto-passes a human-signoff step. There is **no** fallback to `BOBBIT_LLM_REVIEW_SKIP` — a "human" gate must not share a bypass with `agent-qa` / `llm-review`, otherwise the global E2E harness (which sets `BOBBIT_LLM_REVIEW_SKIP=1`) would silently auto-approve every human gate.
- **Rejection feedback.** When the user rejects with feedback, the text lands in the step `output` and a `text/markdown` artifact. The team lead consumes a failed sign-off identically to a failed `llm-review`.

Use sparingly. Most quality concerns are better served by `llm-review` or a command check; reserve `human-signoff` for decisions that genuinely require human judgement (release approval, security exception, design ratification).

## 5. Runtime context tokens

Free-form `run:` strings and `prompt:` bodies may reference:

| Token | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `{{branch}}` | the goal/session branch name |
| `{{baseBranch}}` | the bare integration branch from the project's `base_ref`, falling back to the detected primary branch (e.g. `master`/`main`) |
| `{{master}}` | **deprecated/backwards-compat alias** — always resolves to the detected primary branch regardless of `base_ref`. Prefer `{{baseBranch}}`. |
| `{{goal_spec}}` | full markdown of the goal spec |
| `{{agent.<key>}}` | metadata supplied by the signaling agent |
| `{{<gate_id>.meta.<key>}}` | metadata from a passed upstream gate |

These are substituted by the gate runner before the step executes. **Do not** use `{{project.<key>}}` in command shapes — it is removed in favor of structural `{ component, command }` references. The validator will catch unresolved `{ component, command }` references at load time; unrecognized free-form tokens just pass through to the shell and fail at runtime as ordinary typos.

## 6. Pattern library

These are the typical gate sets per workflow style. Generators MAY extend, prune, or reorder freely.

> All non-quick-fix flows below include **both** a design-time gap-analysis step
> (in `design-doc` / `issue-analysis`) and a post-implementation gap-analysis step
> (in `implementation`, phase 2). See §3.1 — these two checks bracket the Ralph loop.

### 6.1 `general` — lightweight

```yaml
- design-doc       (content; design-review + gap-analysis llm-review)
- implementation   (build/check/unit/e2e in phase 1; gap-analysis + code-review llm-review in phase 2)  # Ralph loop
- documentation    (llm-review)
- ready-to-merge   (push, fast-forward, PR exists)
```

### 6.2 `feature` — full design + impl + multi-review + optional QA

```yaml
- design-doc       (content; design-review + gap-analysis llm-review)
- implementation   (build/check/unit/e2e, gap+code+security llm-review, optional agent-qa)             # Ralph loop
- documentation    (llm-review)
- ready-to-merge   (push/fast-forward/PR)
```

### 6.3 `bug-fix` — TDD

```yaml
- issue-analysis   (content; analysis + gap-analysis llm-review)
- reproducing-test (command with expect: failure; metadata declares test_command)
- implementation   (build/check/unit/e2e, llm-review)                                                  # Ralph loop
- documentation
- ready-to-merge
```

### 6.4 `quick-fix` — minimal

```yaml
- implementation   (build/check/unit/e2e)   # Ralph loop, minimal — no gap analysis
- ready-to-merge
```

### 6.5 Per-component & all-components flows (multi-component projects)

When `components.length > 1`, the project assistant's workflow-suggestion checklist may offer two derived families on top of the canonical templates (no options are pre-checked — the assistant picks them only when they fit the project):

- **Per-component flow** (one entry per component) — a `feature`-shaped workflow scoped to a single component's commands. Built by `buildPerComponentWorkflow(componentName, allComponents)` in `src/server/state-migration/per-component-workflows.ts`. Use when a goal touches only one repo.
- **All-components fan-out flow** — a single `general`-shaped workflow whose `implementation` gate runs `build`/`check`/`unit`/`e2e` across every component with a `commands` map (data-only components are skipped) using `phase:` to parallelise. Built by `buildAllComponentsWorkflow(components)`.

Both helpers reuse the canonical prompts and `readyToMergeGate()` exported by `seed-default-workflows.ts` so gate semantics stay in one place. Don't hand-roll variants in `project.yaml::workflows` — derive from these helpers instead so renaming a step prompt updates every flow.

### 6.5 `pr-review` (opt-in)

```yaml
- review           (llm-review against an existing PR)
```

The `shared` data-only component generates no workflow steps. It's only present so the worktree pool checks it out alongside `api` and `web` on every goal/session branch — the e2e harness in `api` (or a separate `e2e` component) can then `cd ../shared/...` and consume its fixtures at the right revision.

## 8. Anti-patterns

- **Literal shell strings instead of structural references.** `{ run: "npm run build" }` works but loses validator coverage and breaks when the command rotates. Prefer `{ component, command }`.
- **Copy-paste step bodies across phases.** Use `phase:` to parallelize and structural references to share command definitions.
- **Over-broad `expect: failure`.** It's for TDD reproducing-tests where the gate must demonstrate the bug. Don't use it to paper over a flaky build.
- **`{{project.X}}` tokens in command shapes.** Removed; replaced by `{ component, command }`. The migration rewrites known usages on first server boot.
- **Pure `{ run }` steps that pretend to be component-scoped.** If a step belongs to a component, link it: `{ component, run }` so the working directory is correct.
- **Data-only components with workflow steps.** A component with no `commands` cannot be referenced by a structural step. The validator rejects this at load time.
