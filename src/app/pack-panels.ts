// src/app/pack-panels.ts
//
// CLIENT registry of pack-contributed SIDE-PANEL modules (pack schema V1 §8.1;
// design docs/design/pack-schema-v1-rationalisation.md). Panels are now
// PACK-scoped, not anchored to a carrier tool: panel ids are unique only WITHIN
// a pack, so the registry is keyed by the COMPOUND `{packId, panelId}` and the
// lazy loader fetches the pack-addressed endpoint
// GET /api/ext/packs/:packId/panels/:panelId.
//
// This MIRRORS `pack-renderers.ts` + the `renderer-registry.ts`
// generation-guarded chokepoint, but panels are a DISTINCT registry. It copies
// the `applyRegistration` contract (capture generation before any await, drop
// superseded applies, reconcile-on-uninstall) into its OWN map so the registry
// always ends matching the LAST REQUESTED project, never whichever async fetch
// happened to resolve last.
//
// On cold load (and after a marketplace install/uninstall re-fetches
// /api/ext/contributions) the UI calls `reconcilePackPanelsForProject(projectId)`.
// For every pack contribution row it registers each panel keyed by
// `{packId, panelId}`. `openPackPanel(target, callerPackId)` stays PACK-RELATIVE:
// the caller surface's bound packId resolves `panelId` → `{packId, panelId}`,
// lazily imports the panel module through a Blob URL (authed via gatewayFetch —
// the bare module URL would not carry the bearer), invokes its default factory
// handing it the host's own lit toolkit, caches the resulting panel, and
// mounts/focuses a side-panel tab whose content the render layer pulls by
// `{packId, panelId}`.
