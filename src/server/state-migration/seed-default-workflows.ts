Run \`git diff origin/{{baseBranch}}...{{branch}} -- . ':!package-lock.json'\` to see all changes.
Read the key documentation files: AGENTS.md, README.md, and files in docs/.

The goal spec is:
{{goal_spec}}

**Documentation location rules:**
- Detailed feature behavior, architecture explanations, workflows, and durable reference material should usually live in \`docs/*.md\`.
- \`README.md\` should cover entrypoints, setup, and concise high-level project orientation.
- \`AGENTS.md\` should only change when agent-operational guidance changed: repo navigation, architecture launchpad notes, common task recipes, debugging index entries, verification flow, or other instructions an agent needs in many sessions.
- Do NOT require an \`AGENTS.md\` update for routine product or feature documentation when \`docs/\` or \`README.md\` is the better home.

**Check 1 — Every feature is documented:**
- Every new user-facing feature, API endpoint, config option, or behavioral change introduced in this branch must be documented somewhere.
- If a feature is only described in code comments, that is NOT sufficient — it must appear in a .md file.
- List any undocumented features.
- Also flag documentation placed in the wrong home when that placement creates pressure to grow \`AGENTS.md\` unnecessarily.

**Check 2 — Existing documentation is updated:**
- If the changes modify behavior that is already documented, the documentation must be updated to reflect the new behavior.
- Check for stale references: old API signatures, removed config options, renamed files, changed defaults, altered workflows.
- List any stale documentation that was not updated.

**Check 3 — Documentation placement is appropriate:**
- Prefer \`docs/\` for detailed explanations.
- Prefer \`README.md\` for top-level orientation.
- Only require \`AGENTS.md\` changes for agent-facing operational guidance.
- Flag branches that add routine feature detail to \`AGENTS.md\` instead of the better destination.

**Check 4 — AGENTS.md edit discipline (only if this branch modifies AGENTS.md):**
AGENTS.md is loaded into every agent turn — its size is a direct per-turn token cost on every session. FAIL this check if the diff:
- Adds a Recipe or Debugging entry that spans more than one line. Multi-sentence prose, inlined schemas, code blocks, and step-by-step walkthroughs all belong in \`docs/\`, not AGENTS.md.
- Adds a new entry where extending or replacing an existing entry on the same topic would have worked (net adds drive bloat).
- Adds both a Recipe and a Debugging entry for the same fix (pick one).
- Adds a categorical subsection past ~12 entries without splitting it.
If the diff fixes any of the above (e.g. it shortens long entries, dedupes recipe↔debug pairs, splits a large subsection), say so and PASS.

Summarize with PASS/FAIL for each check and specific items to address.`;

Identify:
1. Requirements in the goal spec not addressed in the design
2. Acceptance criteria not covered by the proposed changes

Read the design document content from upstream gates.

Identify:
1. Features described in the goal/design but not implemented
2. Acceptance criteria not met by the code changes
3. Implemented behavior that contradicts the specification

IMPORTANT: Ignore documentation gaps. This gap analysis runs during the implementation phase, BEFORE the documentation gate. Do NOT flag missing or outdated documentation, README updates, design-doc updates, code comments, or other docs-only artifacts as gaps — those are addressed by the dedicated documentation gate later in the workflow. Focus exclusively on code/behavior gaps relative to the spec and design.`;

Then use \`git diff origin/{{baseBranch}}...{{branch}} -M -- . ':!package-lock.json'\` (with rename detection) to see actual content changes.
For large diffs, review files individually with \`read\` rather than dumping the entire diff into context.

Check:
1. Correctness — logic errors, off-by-one, race conditions
2. Error handling — missing try/catch, unhandled promise rejections
3. Edge cases — null/undefined, empty arrays, boundary values
4. Code style — consistent naming, no dead code, clear intent
5. Test coverage — are new behaviors tested?`;

export const SECURITY_REVIEW_PROMPT = `Security review of changes on branch {{branch}} vs origin/{{baseBranch}}.

Run \`git diff origin/{{baseBranch}}...{{branch}} -- . ':!package-lock.json'\` to see changes.

Check:
1. Injection risks — command injection, path traversal, template injection
2. Auth/authz — are new endpoints properly authenticated?
3. Data validation — are inputs validated and sanitized?
4. Secrets handling — no hardcoded secrets, tokens, or credentials
5. Dependency risks — any new dependencies with known vulnerabilities?`;

3. The scope boundary is explicit — what is in vs out of this goal.

Pass if the charter is good enough to plan against. Fail with concrete missing pieces if not.`;

/** Plan structural sanity prompt — does the proposed plan make architectural sense? */
export const PLAN_STRUCTURAL_PROMPT = `Review the structural sanity of the proposed plan.

Verify:
1. Subgoals decompose the parent into independently mergeable units (each merges into the parent's branch on its own).
2. Phase ordering / dependencies are sensible — work that depends on other work is in a later phase.
3. No subgoal duplicates another's scope or contradicts the parent charter.
4. Each subgoal has a clear title, spec, and (if relevant) suggested role.

Pass if the plan is coherent. Fail with concrete restructuring suggestions if not.`;

/** Acceptance-criteria coverage prompt — does the plan cover every criterion? */
export const CRITERIA_COVERAGE_PROMPT = `Verify the proposed plan covers every acceptance criterion in the parent goal's spec.

The criteria-coverage check is a whitespace-normalised, case-insensitive substring match against the union of {parent spec, subgoal step specs}. Hashes do not work — they fail when wording paraphrases. Subgoal specs MUST quote the criteria they cover verbatim (a "## Covers" heading is the convention).

Verify:
1. Every "## Acceptance criteria" bullet from the parent spec appears verbatim somewhere in the plan (parent or any subgoal spec).
2. Each subgoal that targets a criterion makes that link explicit.

Pass if every criterion is verbatim-covered. Fail with the list of uncovered criteria if not.`;

/** Integration LLM-review prompt — once children have merged, does the integrated whole make sense? */
export const INTEGRATION_PROMPT = `Review the cross-component integration after all subgoals have merged.

Run \`git diff origin/{{baseBranch}}...HEAD\` to see the cumulative result on the parent branch.

Verify:
1. Subgoal merges play together — no accidental regressions where one subgoal silently broke another.
2. End-to-end functionality reflects what the parent charter promised (each acceptance criterion now demonstrable on the merged tree).
3. No leftover scaffolding, duplicate definitions, or contradictory configs from the merges.

Pass if the integrated tree is coherent. Fail with concrete issues if not.`;
