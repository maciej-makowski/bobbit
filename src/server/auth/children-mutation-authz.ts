/**
 * S1 — server-side authorization for the MUTATING Children REST endpoints
 * (`spawn-child`, `integrate-child`, `pause`, `resume`, mutation `decision`,
 * `policy`, plan `PATCH`, parent-scoped `archive-child`).
 *
 * Two authorization CLASSES — blast-radius reduction
 * ---------------------------------------------------
 * The original single policy keyed the human-operator signal off the
 * server-verified `bobbit_session` cookie (minted only on a successful Bearer
 * auth, never sent by agents). That closed the absent-header bypass, but the
 * cookie is still only a WEAK human signal: agents read the SHARED gateway
 * admin Bearer token off disk, and any holder of that token can mint a
 * `bobbit_session` cookie. A compromised/rogue agent could therefore forge the
 * cookie and drive ANY Children mutation on ANY goal.
 *
 * To shrink the blast radius we split the mutations into two classes:
 *
 *   ORCHESTRATION — `spawn-child`, plan `PATCH`, `integrate-child`, `policy`.
 *     These are the autonomous team-lead orchestration verbs: they spawn child
 *     teams, rewrite the execution plan, merge child branches, and resize the
 *     concurrency policy. They are NEVER issued by the human/UI gateway path
 *     (the web UI only ever calls the OPERATOR verbs — see `src/app/dialogs.ts`
 *     pause/resume and `children-mutation-approval`'s decision POST). We
 *     therefore require the AUTHENTIC caller session (see below) to match the
 *     goal's team-lead, and IGNORE the cookie entirely: the cookie does NOT
 *     bypass an orchestration check. A forged cookie can no longer spawn
 *     children, mutate plans, integrate branches, or change policy.
 *     Orchestration is refused on a missing/unknown secret, a teamless goal, or
 *     a non-team-lead caller.
 *
 *   OPERATOR — `pause`, `resume`, mutation `decision`, `archive-child`.
 *     These are the human-in-the-loop verbs the web UI actually drives. A
 *     verified `bobbit_session` cookie is accepted (human/UI gateway call);
 *     otherwise we fall back to the same AUTHENTIC team-lead match the
 *     orchestration class uses (so a team-lead agent can also
 *     pause/resume/decide/archive within its own goal).
 *
 * The AUTHENTIC caller — per-session capability secret (S1, replaces the
 * forgeable public header)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The fatal flaw in the original design was trusting `X-Bobbit-Spawning-Session`
 * — a PUBLIC session id any token holder could read and replay. This authz no
 * longer trusts that header for AUTHORIZATION at all. Instead the caller's
 * identity is derived SERVER-SIDE from a per-session secret: every session's
 * process gets a crypto-random `BOBBIT_SESSION_SECRET` in its env (and ONLY that
 * process gets its own — see `session-secret.ts` and `docker-args.ts`); the
 * `children` extension sends it as `X-Bobbit-Session-Secret`; the route resolves
 * it via `SessionSecretStore.resolveSessionIdBySecret()` to the AUTHENTIC
 * session id and passes that here as `authenticCallerSessionId`. A caller that
 * forges the public header but lacks the secret resolves to `undefined` → DENY.
 * The public `X-Bobbit-Spawning-Session` header survives ONLY for non-auth
 * bookkeeping (stamping `spawnedBySessionId`).
 *
 * RESIDUAL RISK (documented, accepted, future work)
 * --------------------------------------------------
 * The OPERATOR endpoints still trust the shared admin Bearer token: any holder
 * of that token can mint the `bobbit_session` cookie and therefore drive the
 * operator verbs. This is an INHERENT property of Bobbit's current single
 * shared-credential model — agents and the human operate the gateway with the
 * same token, so there is no cryptographic way to tell a human operator apart
 * from a token-holding agent on the cookie path. FULL separation requires a
 * dedicated OPERATOR credential (a distinct human-only secret, e.g. a separate
 * login session or a per-operator token) that agents never possess. That is
 * out of scope here and tracked as future work — see
 * `docs/design/production-subgoals-port.md`. The orchestration/operator split
 * plus the per-session secret shrink the blast radius (orchestration is now
 * bound to the AUTHENTIC team-lead and is both cookie-proof and header-forge-
 * proof) without claiming to fully isolate the operator surface.
 *
 * Authentic-caller handling
 * --------------------------
 * `authenticCallerSessionId` is NEVER trusted as a bare authorization claim — it
 * is only ever compared for equality against the `TeamManager`'s authoritative
 * team-lead session id for the goal being mutated, AND it is itself derived from
 * an unforgeable secret. A teamless goal has no legitimate agent caller, so a
 * non-cookie caller is denied (orchestration always; the operator class still
 * allows the human cookie).
 *
 * Decision tables
 * ---------------
 *   ORCHESTRATION (cookie does NOT bypass):
 *   | authentic caller | team-lead known | result                          |
 *   |------------------|-----------------|---------------------------------|
 *   | none (no secret) | —               | DENY  (403, no-authentic-caller) |
 *   | resolved         | none            | DENY  (403, no-team-lead)       |
 *   | resolved         | matches caller  | ALLOW (team-lead-match)         |
 *   | resolved         | mismatches      | DENY  (403, team-lead-mismatch) |
 *
 *   OPERATOR (human cookie OR authentic team-lead match):
 *   | human cookie | authentic caller | team-lead known | result                   |
 *   |--------------|------------------|-----------------|--------------------------|
 *   | yes          | —                | —               | ALLOW (human-cookie)     |
 *   | no           | none (no secret) | —               | DENY  (no-authentic-caller) |
 *   | no           | resolved         | none            | DENY  (no-team-lead)     |
 *   | no           | resolved         | matches caller  | ALLOW (team-lead-match)  |
 *   | no           | resolved         | mismatches      | DENY  (team-lead-mismatch) |
