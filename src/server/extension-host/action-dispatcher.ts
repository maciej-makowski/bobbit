// src/server/extension-host/action-dispatcher.ts
//
// The SERVER extension host's action dispatcher (design
// docs/design/extension-host.md §4b / §5). A pack tool ships
// `tools/<group>/actions.js` exporting `export const actions = { retry: ... }`.
// The dispatcher resolves the WINNING module through the SAME precedence
// `ToolManager` already uses (`resolveToolLocation()` → `{baseDir, groupDir,
// actionsModule}`, independent of `provider:` — design §4b), loads + caches it
// keyed by absolute-path + mtime (mirroring
// `scanToolsDirCached`), and runs the handler under the blast-radius controls
// from §5 control iv: a per-call TIMEOUT, a global CONCURRENCY cap, a per-session
// token-bucket RATE limit, and try/catch ISOLATION so a crashing handler becomes
// an HTTP error and never takes down the long-lived gateway process.
//
// The single call site of `module.actions[action](ctx, args)` is the confined
// worker (`ModuleHost.invoke`) — the documented seam (§5 iv / §9). The PARENT
// gateway process NEVER imports pack code: it only resolves + validates the
// module PATH and builds the epoch-cache-busted URL the worker re-imports. Module
// import, export-map lookup, and member validation all run INSIDE the worker, so
// pack top-level code can never execute in this privileged process.
