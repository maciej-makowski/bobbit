// src/server/extension-host/confinement-loader.ts
//
// The module-IMPORT containment hook half of the server-module isolation. This is
// loader / stability hygiene — NOT a security boundary. Pack server code is TRUSTED
// (tool/MCP tier) and runs with full ambient parity (normal `node:` built-ins, incl.
// `fs`); confining the pack's module GRAPH to its own root just keeps a pack from
// accidentally (or sloppily) reaching into another pack's files via the loader, and
// keeps the loader graph predictable. It does not — and is not meant to — stop a
// trusted pack from reading arbitrary files (it can `import("node:fs")` and read
// anything the gateway can).
//
// This module exports a SYNCHRONOUS `resolve` hook + a `configure` setter that the
// worker BOOTSTRAP (`module-host-bootstrap.ts`) installs via Node's IN-THREAD
// `module.registerHooks({ resolve })` BEFORE the pack server module (an
// `actions`/`routes` module) is dynamic-imported. In-thread (synchronous) hooks
// run in the SAME worker thread as the bootstrap — NOT a separate hooks thread —
// which is deliberate: it lets the guard run synchronously from the hook with no
// cross-thread marshalling and no module-customization-graph `.ts`/`.js`
// resolution gap. The realpath-containment guard (`path-guard`) is INJECTED by the
// bootstrap via `configure({ isWithin })` rather than imported here directly: the
// bootstrap loads `path-guard` (and its `node:fs` dep) only AFTER it has applied
// the session-dir module wraps, so the `node:fs` ESM facade is created AFTER the
// fs relative-path rebasing wrap is in place (importing it here would pre-build the
// facade during the static-import phase and defeat the wrap).
//
// The hook enforces ONE thing on every resolution the pack module graph makes:
//
//   PACK-ROOT CONTAINMENT — every resolved `file:` URL must be realpath-contained
//   within the validated pack group directory (the SAME root the dispatcher used to
//   load + validate the entry module). Without this, a pack module could
//   `import`/`require` a file OUTSIDE its own pack via a `../` walk, an absolute
//   path, a symlink escape, or a bare specifier that resolves into an ancestor
//   `node_modules`. Containment reuses the SHARED `isPackPathWithinRoot` path-guard
//   helper so the lexical + realpath checks stay byte-consistent with the HTTP
//   entry-serving endpoints.
//
// This containment hook is one half of the isolation; the other (terminate /
// resource caps / spawned-child kill) lives in module-host-worker.ts — that is the
// genuine, defensible boundary. This hook is import hygiene only.
