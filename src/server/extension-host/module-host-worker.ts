// src/server/extension-host/module-host-worker.ts
//
// Server-module RESOURCE + CRASH isolation. Runs a pack server module member (an
// `actions`/`routes` handler) in a terminate-able `worker_threads` Worker with
// resource caps, behind a request/response message protocol whose only proxied
// capability back to the parent is the host-API proxy.
//
// Pack SERVER code is TRUSTED — the same tier as a tool or MCP server the user
// chose to install — so it runs with FULL ambient parity: normal `node:` built-ins,
// normal network globals, the normal `process` (full env). There is NO capability
// sandbox; a per-capability sandbox over trusted in-process code is false security
// (a native `.node` addon or the shared process trivially defeats it). The ONLY
// isolation kept is the kind that is genuine:
//
//   - **Resource/crash isolation:** terminate-on-timeout (also the CPU control —
//     worker_threads has no per-core throttle), `resourceLimits` memory/stack caps,
//     and SIGKILL of any spawned OS child on terminate. The parent races a timer; on
//     timeout it calls `worker.terminate()` (true cancellation) + kills tracked
//     children and rejects 504.
//   - **Module-import containment** (in `module-host-bootstrap.ts` /
//     `confinement-loader.ts`): the pack module graph can only resolve `file:` URLs
//     within the pack root. This is cheap loader/stability hygiene, NOT a security
//     boundary (fs is ambient now).
//
// This is the execution strategy the dispatchers' SINGLE invocation seam swaps
// onto (action-dispatcher.ts / route-dispatcher.ts): `ModuleHost.invoke(...)`
// replaces the in-process `handler(ctx, args)` call WITHOUT touching callers. The
// dispatcher keeps its blast-radius controls (per-session rate limit, global
// concurrency cap, permit-held-until-the-work-settles, bounded reload retry); the
// worker adds what Phase 1 could not — TRUE termination of a runaway handler.
//
// **Isolation is UNCONDITIONAL.** There is NO config flag, env var, or runtime
// toggle that runs a pack server module in-process in any shippable/packaged/CI
// build. The dispatchers ALWAYS route their seam through `ModuleHost.invoke`; there
// is no in-process fallback to gate, so the shipped configuration can never disable
// the resource/crash isolation.
