// src/server/extension-host/module-host-bootstrap.ts
//
// The WORKER ENTRY for server-module RESOURCE + CRASH isolation.
//
// This module is the `Worker` entry spawned by `ModuleHost.invoke`
// (module-host-worker.ts). It runs in a worker thread whose memory is capped by
// `resourceLimits` and that inherits a full copy of the gateway env.
//
// **Trust model (Model A).** Pack SERVER code is TRUSTED — same tier as a tool or
// MCP server the user chose to install — so it runs with FULL ambient parity:
// normal `node:` built-ins (`fs`/`child_process`/`net`/`http`…), normal network
// globals (`fetch`/`WebSocket`), and the normal `process` (full env). There is NO
// capability sandbox; a per-capability sandbox over trusted in-process code is false
// security (a native `.node` addon or the shared process trivially defeats it). The
// worker is purely a RESOURCE + CRASH isolation boundary (terminate-on-timeout,
// mem/cpu caps, spawned-child kill) plus module-import containment to the pack root
// (loader/stability hygiene, NOT a security boundary).
//
// The ONLY behavioral adjustments the bootstrap makes to otherwise-ambient Node are
// driven by `workingDir`, are UNCONDITIONAL, and are tool-parity convenience +
// resource hygiene — never a containment boundary:
//
//   - `process.cwd()` → `workingDir`: a tool/MCP server runs rooted at the session
//     worktree; worker threads cannot `chdir()`, so `process.cwd` is overridden to
//     return `workingDir`. Nothing else on `process` is touched (full env, real
//     `argv`/`execPath`/`exit`/`kill`/`binding`/…). This hides nothing.
//   - async child-process spawners default their `cwd` to `workingDir` (an explicit
//     `cwd` is respected verbatim) and report each spawned pid to the parent so the
//     resource-isolation layer can SIGKILL any survivor on terminate-on-timeout.
//   - synchronous child-process spawners get the same default-cwd plus an injected
//     `timeout`/`killSignal` clamped below the wall-cap (a blocking sync child can't
//     report its pid — the thread is frozen — so Node must SIGKILL it before
//     terminate reaps the thread, else the OS child orphans).
//   - LEADING bare-relative `fs` path arguments are rebased onto `workingDir` so
//     relative fs resolves consistently with the overridden `process.cwd()` (libuv's
//     real cwd stays the gateway's). Absolute / Buffer / URL paths pass through; no
//     path is ever rejected.
//
// Bootstrap order:
//
//   1. Statically import `worker_threads` + `module` + the confinement hook
//      (`confinement-loader.ts`) — so the static-import phase creates NO `node:fs`
//      ESM facade. Then, in `confinementReady`, APPLY the session-dir module wraps
//      FIRST (child-process default-cwd + tracking / fs relative-path rebasing —
//      CONVENIENCE, not a boundary) so they are in place BEFORE the `node:fs` facade
//      is created, and only AFTER that dynamically import the shared `path-guard`
//      helper (which creates the now-wrapped facade) and inject its module-import
//      containment check into the confinement loader.
//   2. Install the module-import containment hook (`confinement-loader.ts`) via the
//      IN-THREAD `module.registerHooks({ resolve })`, so the pack module graph
//      imported afterward cannot `import`/`require` any `file:` OUTSIDE its own pack
//      root (relative `../` walk, absolute path, symlink, or ancestor
//      `node_modules`). This is a loader/stability concern, not a security boundary.
//   3. Override `process.cwd()` to the session working dir (tool parity).
//   4. On an `invoke` message: dynamic-import the pack module at the SAME
//      epoch-cache-busted URL the dispatcher built, build a `ctx.host` PROXY whose
//      store/session calls are marshalled back to the parent over the MessagePort
//      (host calls are AUTHORIZED in the parent; those cross-pack/cross-session
//      boundaries ARE enforced), invoke `module[exportKind][member](ctx, arg)`, and
//      post the result.
