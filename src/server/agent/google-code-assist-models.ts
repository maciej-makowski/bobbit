/**
 * Account-backed Gemini model list for the `google-gemini-cli` (Code Assist / OAuth)
 * provider. Metadata is derived from pi-ai's built-in `google` catalog so context
 * windows / costs stay in sync, but the models are re-emitted under provider
 * `google-gemini-cli` with `api: "google-code-assist"` so the runtime routes them to
 * the Code Assist Bearer adapter instead of the API-key Gemini Developer API.
 *
 * Models are only emitted when a Google account credential is present (see
 * `hasGoogleCodeAssistCredential`), so the selector is not cluttered with
 * non-functional account models for users who never log in with Google.
 *
 * These models ARE runnable in agent sessions: the generated Code Assist provider
 * extension registers a `google-code-assist` api inside the pi-coding-agent runtime
 * and streams to `cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com`, fetching a fresh Bearer token +
 * project id from the gateway per request. They are therefore emitted as
 * session-selectable. The API-key `google` (Gemini Developer API) provider is a
 * distinct wire protocol and is unaffected.
 *
 * Caution: Google account (Code Assist / Gemini CLI) usage is subject to the
 * account's Code Assist quota/tier and is not the official AI Studio API path.
 *
 * Design: docs/design/google-session-models.md; docs/design/google-oauth-model-auth.md §4.5.

 * those made them selectable and produced live HTTP 404 session failures.
 *
 * Membership was confirmed against live Code Assist probes (see
