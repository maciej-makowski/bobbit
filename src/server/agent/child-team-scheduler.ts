/**
 * Unified per-root child-team scheduler.
 *
 * THE single authority for how many child teams run concurrently under one
 * goal tree. Before this module the per-root concurrency cap lived only in
 * `VerificationHarness.runSubgoalStep` (the harness-driven plan path); direct
 * `goal_spawn_child` REST spawns, `POST /api/goals` child creation, and the
 * `integrate-child` dependency auto-unblock all started child teams WITHOUT
 * acquiring a permit — so the cap could be bypassed (e.g. cap=1 + several
 * spawn-child calls start multiple teams; one merge that unblocks several
 * dependents starts them all at once).
 *
 * Every code path that would START a child team now routes through this
 * scheduler:
 *   - harness `runSubgoalStep` (via the shared per-root `Semaphore`, blocking
 *     acquire + long hold across the child's lifecycle), and
 *   - the REST/POST start paths (via `requestStart`, a NON-blocking try —
 *     either it starts now under a permit, or the child is parked
 *     capacity-blocked and enqueued).
 *
 * The semaphore IS the scheduler — there is NO poll loop. A permit is freed by
 * a terminal child event (`notifyTerminal`: merge / archive / completion) or by
 * the harness releasing its held permit (`startNextEligible`), and that release
 * synchronously starts the next eligible queued child. Live `PATCH /policy`
 * cap resizes apply in place via `resize` (and pay down / pick up pending work).
 *
 * Capacity bookkeeping is in-memory (like the original per-root semaphore) and
 * keyed by `rootGoalId`.
