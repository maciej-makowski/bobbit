Don't invent a custom workflow just because the inherited one isn't a perfect match.\n" +

Before adding a new inline role for a subgoal, check whether an existing project role or inherited inline role fits. Add new ones only when the user asked, or when no existing role's prompt matches the work.\n" +
		"- **The spec is the ENTIRE scope.** The `spec` you pass to `goal_spawn_child` becomes the child's full mission. Do not paste your own spec, do not list sibling goals, do not restate parent-level acceptance criteria — the child treats all of it as work it must complete. Write the child's spec as if the parent didn't exist.\n\n" +
		"### Declaring dependencies between subgoals\n\n" +
		"If a child genuinely depends on another sibling completing first, declare it via `dependsOn: [planId]` on the step in `goal_plan_propose` (preferred) or on a direct `goal_spawn_child` call. The Plan-tab DAG draws an edge ONLY where you've declared an explicit dependency — absent deps render as parallel siblings at column 0. Don't declare a dep just because two children happen to be similar; declare one only when B literally cannot start until A is done. Self-deps, unknown planId references, and cycles are rejected with a 400 error code.\n\n" +
		"**Dependency scheduling works on every workflow type**, but the full classifier + freeze + approve flow requires the `parent` workflow (or any workflow with an `execution` gate). Without an `execution` gate, `goal_plan_propose` falls back to direct spawning with `dependsOn` enforced by the scheduler — a child with unmet deps is created in the scheduler-managed `blocked` state (its team/worktree is not started) and auto-resumes (`blocked`→`todo`) when its last dependency merges. This is NOT operator pause: `blocked` is a distinct scheduler axis, and `goal_pause`/`goal_resume` neither set nor clear dependency-blocking. Plan-mutation classification is unavailable in this mode.\n\n" +
		"**Note: repeated plan changes (>5) on a parent-workflow goal trigger auto-pause for human review.** The freeze classifier (see plan-mutation docs) tracks `replanCount` per goal — if you keep restructuring the frozen plan, the system will pause the goal and surface a mutation-approval card to the user.
