/**
 * Market-pack bundler — the command behind `npm run build:packs` (wired into
 * `npm run build`, so CI/E2E always get fresh bundles).
 *
 * CONVENTION (Extension Host Phase 2, Slice D1 parity hardening): a pack's CLIENT
 * contributions (renderers, panels) may now `import` npm deps in their SOURCE
 * (`market-packs/<pack>/src/*`). esbuild bundles each entry into a single,
 * self-contained ESM written to the pack's SERVED location. Each entry declares
 * its `out` path RELATIVE TO THE PACK ROOT (V1 schema), so tool renderers may
 * stay tool-local (`tools/<group>/<entry>.js`) while panels and other shared
 * bundles emit to the pack's `lib/` dir (`lib/<entry>.js`) — the new home for
 * shared implementation modules. The marketplace ships the BUILT assets as-is.
 * The built bundles are committed.
 *
 * Two hard rules make a bundle loadable by the Phase-1/2 client loader, which
 * imports the module via a Blob URL and hands it the host toolkit as a FACTORY
 * parameter (see src/app/pack-renderers.ts / pack-panels.ts):
 *   1. NEVER bundle `lit` — it is injected (`{ html, nothing, renderHeader }`).
 *      `lit`/`lit/*` are marked EXTERNAL; pack source must not import them.
 *   2. SINGLE self-contained file per entry — NO code splitting / dynamic chunks.
 *      A Blob-URL module has no resolvable base for `import("./chunk.js")`, so
 *      every dep (highlight.js, pdfjs-dist, docx-preview) is inlined eagerly.
 *
 * pdfjs WORKER: pdfjs needs a worker but a Blob-URL module cannot resolve a
 * sibling worker file and there is no pack-asset endpoint. We pre-bundle the
 * worker SOURCE to a string and expose it as the `virtual:pdf-worker` module; the
 * pack creates a Blob-URL `workerSrc` from it at runtime (see binary-render.ts).
