# Bobbit

[![CI](https://github.com/maciej-makowski/bobbit/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/maciej-makowski/bobbit/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

**Your AI dev team, running on your machine, controlled from your browser.**

Bobbit is a command centre for AI coding agents. Spin up teams — leads that plan, coders that build in parallel, reviewers and testers that enforce quality — and point them at anything from a quick bug fix to a full-stack feature. Watch every agent work in real time, steer them mid-task, and stay in control of what ships.

<!-- TODO: Add a demo GIF showing a full session — prompt → agent reading files → editing → running tests → done -->

## Quick start

```bash
npx bobbit
```

That's it. Bobbit scaffolds a `.bobbit/` config directory, starts a gateway on `http://localhost:3001`, and opens your browser. Send your first prompt and watch it work.

For a detailed walkthrough of your first session, see the **[Getting Started guide](docs/getting-started.md)**.

## Quick start (from source)

If you have a Bobbit source checkout, use the `run` script to launch it against any project directory — no global install needed.

```bash
git clone <repo> bobbit

# From your project directory:
/path/to/bobbit/run                    # Linux/macOS
C:\path\to\bobbit\run.cmd              # Windows
```

On first run, the script auto-installs dependencies and builds (`npm install && npm run build`). On subsequent runs, it detects when source files have changed since the last build and rebuilds automatically — so `git pull && ./run` just works.

Each project gets its own `.bobbit/` state directory, and ports auto-increment so you can run multiple instances side by side. All CLI flags are forwarded:

```bash
/path/to/bobbit/run --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3005 --no-tls
```

See **[Run from Checkout](docs/run-from-checkout.md)** for full details, PATH integration, and troubleshooting.

### CLI flags

```
bobbit [options]

--host <addr>       Bind address (default: localhost)
--port <n>          Port (default: 3001)
--nord              Bind to NordLynx mesh IP (remote access via NordVPN meshnet)
--tls / --no-tls    Override TLS auto-detection
--cwd <dir>         Working directory for agent sessions (default: .)
--agent-cli <path>  Path to pi-coding-agent cli.js
--static <dir>      Serve a custom UI build directory
--no-ui             Gateway-only mode (no UI)
--new-token         Force-generate a new auth token
--show-token        Print the current token and exit
```

### From source

```bash
git clone <repo> && cd bobbit
npm install
npm run build     # compile server + bundle UI
npm start         # start gateway on :3001
```

The UI build enforces bundle budgets via `tests/bundle-size.test.ts`: the main `index-*.js` chunk ≤ **250 kB gzipped**, every non-worker chunk ≤ **200 kB gzipped**, and no non-worker chunk over **600 kB raw** (which pins Vite's `chunkSizeWarningLimit`). Run `npm run test:bundle` to build and assert in one shot. See [docs/design/ui-bundle-size-reduction.md](docs/design/ui-bundle-size-reduction.md) for the route-splitting and lazy-loading patterns that keep the bundle small.

### From global install

```bash
npm install -g bobbit
bobbit
```

## Why Bobbit?

Most AI coding tools are either locked inside an IDE or limited to a terminal. Bobbit is different:

- **Use any device** — Work from your laptop, phone, or tablet. Start a task on your desktop, check progress from your phone. Multiple devices can connect to the same session simultaneously.
- **Full agent power** — The agent has real shell access. It reads your codebase, edits files, runs builds and tests, searches the web, and automates browsers. No copy-pasting code snippets.
- **Watch everything happen** — Every file read, shell command, and edit streams to your browser in real time with rich tool-call renderers. You see exactly what the agent is doing and can steer it at any point.
- **Sessions survive everything** — Sessions persist to disk. Restart the server, close your browser, lose your connection — pick up right where you left off.
- **Zero config** — `npx bobbit` and you're running. No API keys to configure (uses your existing `~/.pi/` credentials), no Docker, no cloud setup.
- **Runs anywhere, even offline** — `npm install bobbit` uses only the npm registry, with no compile step and no postinstall network fetches. The `fd` and `rg` search binaries ship as a small (~3–5 MB) per-platform optional npm sub-package so search works out of the box without runtime downloads; airgapped machines and corporate networks are first-class. A startup connectivity probe wires `PI_OFFLINE=1` through to agent subprocesses when the network is unreachable, so search tools fail fast with a clear error instead of stalling on doomed downloads.

## Features

### Multi-Project Support
Register multiple project directories with a single Bobbit server. Each project gets its own `.bobbit/` directory for config and state. Config cascades hierarchically (global → server → project). Sessions, goals, and search are scoped per project, with cross-project search enabled by default. The sidebar always groups work under collapsible project folder rows. When only one project is registered, its row defaults to expanded.

### Sessions
Each session is a running agent with its own conversation and persistence. Run multiple sessions in parallel, each working on different parts of your project. Connect from multiple devices at once.

### Goals & Tasks
Track larger work items with structured goals. Each goal has a title, spec, state, and optional task board. Goals can create dedicated git worktrees for isolated work.

### Teams
Coordinate multiple agents working together. A team lead spawns role agents (coder, reviewer, tester) that work on tasks in parallel, each in their own git worktree.

### Workflows & Gates
Define quality stages — design, implement, test, review — as a DAG of gates. Each gate has criteria and enforced ordering. No cutting corners: the agent can't skip ahead.

### Roles
Control what agents can do (tool access, system prompts) and how they behave. Use built-in roles or create your own.

### Skills
Reusable templates for isolated sub-agents: code review, security review, test reports. Invoke them from any session for structured, repeatable outputs.

### Marketplace
Distribute and install roles, tools, and skills as self-contained **packs** — directories you install from a git repo or local source. Installing copies a pack in; uninstalling deletes it; resolution walks one ordered list of packs so installed entities show up on the Roles/Tools/Skills pages tagged with their origin pack. See [docs/marketplace.md](docs/marketplace.md).

### Interactive Agent Prompts
Agents can ask you structured multiple-choice questions mid-task via the builtin `ask_user_choices` tool. An inline widget renders in the chat with up to 5 questions and an always-rendered free-text "Other" escape hatch. The tool is non-blocking — the agent's turn ends immediately and the session goes idle until you submit; your answers arrive as a tagged user message that wakes the agent on the next turn. See [docs/non-blocking-ask.md](docs/non-blocking-ask.md) for the architecture.

### MCP Server Integration
Use any [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server with Bobbit. Drop a `.mcp.json` in your project root (same format as Claude Code) and Bobbit auto-discovers, connects, and exposes all MCP tools — appearing in the Tools UI, system prompts, and role-based access control.

Each MCP server is presented to the model as a **single tool** (`mcp_<server>`) with on-demand operation discovery via `mcp_describe` — fixing context bloat and the OpenAI 128-tool cap when many MCP servers are installed. See [docs/mcp-meta-tools.md](docs/mcp-meta-tools.md).

### Cost Tracking
Per-session token usage and cost, aggregated to goal and task level. Always know what you're spending.

### The Bobbit Mascot
A squishy pixel-art blob that lives in the UI — animated, expressive, and drawn entirely with CSS box-shadows. Each session gets its own colour identity. Role accessories (crown, magnifying glass, bandana) show what the agent is doing at a glance. See the [sprite system docs](docs/bobbit-sprites.md).

See the [development workflow guide](docs/dev-workflow.md) for dev setup, and [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for repo layout and common tasks.

Every PR into `master` runs CI (typecheck, knip, unit). The browser/API E2E suite runs as a separate, **manually-triggered** workflow (Actions → E2E → "Run workflow"). See [Continuous Integration](docs/dev-workflow.md#continuous-integration-ci) for what runs, what's intentionally excluded, and how to run E2E on demand.
