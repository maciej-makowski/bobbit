# Hindsight memory pack (external mode)

Bobbit ships a built-in [first-party pack](marketplace.md#built-in-first-party-packs) named
**`hindsight`** that gives agents persistent, cross-session **memory** backed by a running
Hindsight instance (an external memory/recall service you host yourself). It is the first production
[lifecycle provider](lifecycle-hub.md): instead of every session starting cold, the provider
**recalls** relevant past memories into the prompt and **retains** a compact summary of each turn,
so knowledge accrues across goals, sessions, and (optionally) projects.

This page documents how the pack behaves and how to turn it on. The implementation blueprint —
exact request/response body mapping, the test plan, and the host-side seams it depends on — lives
in [docs/design/hindsight-pack-external.md](design/hindsight-pack-external.md), whose §7 also
covers the topology rationale (one shared bank, tag-scoped) summarised under
[Bank & tag taxonomy](#bank--tag-taxonomy) below.

> **Scope of this release (Extension Platform G2.1 + G2.2).** Only **external mode** ships — you
> point the pack at a Hindsight URL you already run. The managed Docker/Postgres runtime, the
> explicit `hindsight_recall/retain/reflect` agent tools, the native memory panel, the reflect UI,
> and cross-engine dedupe are **out of scope** here — see [Non-goals](#non-goals).

## Installed but dormant by default

The pack is in the built-in band, so it is **present and active by default** on a fresh install —
but it does **nothing** until a Hindsight URL is configured. This is a hard, tested guarantee, not
a soft default:

- The provider declares `activation.requiresConfig: [externalUrl]` in
  `providers/memory.yaml`. The host omits the provider entirely from
  `listProviders(projectId)` until the effective config has a **non-empty `externalUrl`**.
- Consequently, on an unconfigured install there is **no active provider**: no provider-bridge
  pi extension is spawned, no per-turn `/provider-hooks/*` calls are made, the assembled
  system-prompt text is **byte-identical** to a no-pack baseline, and **no Hindsight network is
  touched**.
- The provider also re-checks the same gate defensively at runtime (`isActive(cfg)` in
  `market-packs/hindsight/src/shared.ts`): unless `mode === "external"` **and** `externalUrl` is a
  non-empty string, every hook returns immediately (`{ blocks: [] }` for recall hooks, a no-op for
  retain hooks) and constructs no client.

**Why dormant-by-default?** Memory is only useful if a backing store exists, and Bobbit must never
make outbound calls or change prompts for users who have not opted in. Shipping the pack dormant
means the feature is one config field away without imposing any cost — latency, network, or prompt
drift — on everyone else.

Like any first-party pack, you can also fully **disable** it from the Market UI; disabling is the
only opt-out (there is no uninstall for built-in packs). See
[built-in first-party packs](marketplace.md#built-in-first-party-packs).

## Turning it on

Set the provider config (via the `config` pack route — see [Pack routes](#pack-routes)) with at
least `externalUrl` pointing at your Hindsight base URL (default Hindsight port is `8888`). Once
the effective config has a non-empty URL, the provider activates on the next session spawn and
starts recalling and retaining.

### Configuration keys

The config surface is declared in `market-packs/hindsight/providers/memory.yaml` and mirrored as
flat defaults in `market-packs/hindsight/src/shared.ts` (`CONFIG_DEFAULTS`). Store overrides are
overlaid on these defaults by the loader, so `ctx.config` is the single source of truth the
provider reads.

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mode` | enum `external` \| `managed` | `external` | Deployment mode. **`managed` is reserved for G3** and does nothing here; only `external` activates the provider. |
| `externalUrl` | string (optional) | — | Base URL of your running Hindsight. **Empty ⇒ dormant.** This is the single field that switches the pack on. |
| `apiKey` | secret (optional) | — | Bearer token. Sent as `Authorization: Bearer <apiKey>` **only when set**; never echoed back (the `config` GET surface collapses it to a boolean `apiKeySet`). |
| `bank` | string | `bobbit` | The shared memory bank id (see [Bank & tag taxonomy](#bank--tag-taxonomy)). |
| `namespace` | string | `default` | Hindsight namespace path segment. |
| `recallScope` | enum `project` \| `all` | `all` | `all` recalls across the whole bank (cross-project); `project` adds a `project:<id>` tag filter. |
| `autoRecall` | boolean | `true` | When false, the recall hooks contribute no blocks. |
| `autoRetain` | boolean | `true` | When false, the retain hooks store nothing. |
| `recallBudget` | number | `1200` | Token budget passed as `max_tokens` to recall (bounds the upstream payload; host-side budgeting still applies). |
| `timeoutMs` | number | `1500` | Per-request abort budget for the REST client. |

The `config` route validates overrides against this schema before persisting; an empty string
clears an optional string (`externalUrl`/`apiKey`), and numeric keys must be positive.

## Bank & tag taxonomy

**One shared, tag-scoped bank.** All Bobbit memory lives in a single Hindsight bank, id from
`config.bank` (default **`bobbit`**) in namespace `config.namespace` (default **`default`**).
Multiple Bobbit instances pointed at one Hindsight **share** the `bobbit` bank by default; isolate
them only by configuring a different bank id.

**Why one bank instead of per-project banks?** Hindsight banks are isolated and cross-bank search
is unsupported — you can only recall within a single bank. A per-project bank fan-out would make
the headline value prop ("have we solved this anywhere before?") impossible as one native query.
So Bobbit uses **one bank + tags**: scope is expressed as recall-time tag filters, not as separate
banks. Full rationale: [docs/design/hindsight-pack-external.md §7](design/hindsight-pack-external.md).

**Auto-tags on retain.** The agent never hand-tags; the provider derives tags from the hook
context and flattens them to Hindsight's `string[]` item tags as `"<key>:<value>"`:

| Tag | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `project:<projectId>` | `ctx.projectId` | Omitted when there is no project (global/server-scope session). |
| `goal:<goalId>` | `ctx.goalId` | |
| `agent:<roleName>` | `ctx.roleName` | The contributing agent's role. |
| `session:<sessionId>` | `ctx.sessionId` | |
| `kind:turn` / `kind:compaction` | derived | `turn` for `afterTurn`, `compaction` for `beforeCompact`. The `retain` pack route tags manual writes `kind:manual`. |

**Recall scope.**

- `all` (default) — recall across the whole `bobbit` bank with **no project filter**. This is the
  cross-project value: a query like "how did we configure X?" can surface a memory from any
  project.
- `project` — add a `project:<projectId>` tag filter (`tags_match: "any"`, so untagged org-wide
  memories still surface). The filter is applied **only when configured**; the default never
  narrows.

The provider calls the idempotent `client.ensureBank(bank)` before each retain path, so
correctness never depends on once-per-session in-memory state (provider workers are per-hook and
stateless).

## Provider lifecycle behaviour

The provider implements the five [Lifecycle Hub](lifecycle-hub.md) hooks. It runs on the Extension
Host worker tier, reads merged config from `ctx.config`, builds a REST client per hook, and keeps
all durable state in the pack-scoped `ctx.host.store`. Every Hindsight condition is **non-fatal**:
a slow or unhealthy backend never blocks or fails a session — recalls skip and retains queue.

| Hook | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `sessionSetup` | If `autoRecall`: recall against the goal/task spec (`ctx.prompt`) and inject the results as a **"Relevant memory"** context block (`authority: "memory"`). On error/timeout ⇒ no block + a diagnostic. |
| `beforePrompt` | If `autoRecall`: recall against the current user turn (`ctx.prompt`) under the provider `timeoutMs` deadline; skip on timeout (non-fatal). Same block mapping. |
| `afterTurn` | If `autoRetain`: build a compact turn summary (user + final assistant text, capped ~2000 chars) and **async** retain it (fire-and-forget). On failure, enqueue for retry. Also drains one [retry-queue](#retry-queue--diagnostics) head per call. |
| `beforeCompact` | If `autoRetain`: **synchronously** retain a summary of the about-to-be-lost span, so the memory lands before context is dropped. Failure ⇒ enqueue. |
| `sessionShutdown` | Best-effort **one-pass** drain of the retry queue. Never throws. |

The recall hooks return `ContextBlock[]` only — **fencing and `providerId` are the host's job**
(see [Lifecycle Hub → fencing](lifecycle-hub.md#fencing)). Each block is titled "Relevant memory",
`authority: "memory"`, `priority: 50`, with `content` a bulleted list of recalled memory text. An
empty recall produces no block.

### Retry queue & diagnostics

A retain that fails (network/timeout/HTTP) is **not lost**. The provider appends
`{ content, tags, ts }` to a durable queue in the pack store (key `retain-queue`):

- **Cap 100** — appending past 100 entries drops the oldest (FIFO eviction).
- **Drain on `afterTurn`** — each turn retries the **queue head** (one entry) before doing the
  turn's own retain; success removes it, failure leaves it.
- **Drain on `sessionShutdown`** — one best-effort full pass.

The queue is durable (not in-memory) precisely because provider workers terminate after every hook
invocation, so an in-memory queue would lose everything between turns. Recall skips, retain
failures, and health flips are recorded as non-fatal diagnostics (`last-error` in the store and the
Hub's [context-trace](lifecycle-hub.md#the-trace-store)), and the queue depth is surfaced by the
`status` route.

## Pack routes

The pack ships server routes (`market-packs/hindsight/src/routes.ts`, declared in `pack.yaml`
under `routes.names`) for diagnostics and config persistence, reached via
`host.callRoute(<name>)` and executed in the confined worker. They share the **same pack-scoped
store** as the provider, so `status` observes the provider's real queue and last error. When the
pack is not configured, every route returns a clean structured signal (`configured: false` / empty
list) rather than erroring.

| Route | Contract |
|---|---|
| `config` | GET → merged effective config with secrets redacted (`apiKey` collapsed to `apiKeySet`). SET (with body) → validate against the schema, persist overrides to the pack store, return the new effective config. |
| `status` | `{ configured, mode, healthy, bank, namespace, recallScope, autoRecall, autoRetain, queueDepth, lastError? }`. `healthy` is a fresh `client.health()` probe when configured (short timeout), else `false`. `queueDepth` is the retry-queue length. |
| `recall` | `{ query, scope? }` → resolves bank + tags and calls `client.recall`; returns `{ memories }`. Manual/diagnostic surface. |
| `retain` | `{ content, tags?, sync? }` → `ensureBank` + `client.retain` with merged auto-tags (`kind:manual`); returns `{ ok }`. |
| `reflect` | `{ prompt }` → `client.reflect` → `{ text }`. |
| `banks` | Diagnostic: `client.listBanks()` → `{ banks }`. The pack itself uses one bank. |

## REST client

`market-packs/hindsight/src/hindsight-client.ts` is a thin, faithful mapping over the Hindsight
HTTP API (`/v1/{namespace}/banks/{bank}/…`). Body shapes are mapped per the upstream `openapi.json`
(Hindsight 0.8.x); see [the design doc §3](design/hindsight-pack-external.md) for the exact request
and response mapping. Behaviour pinned by `tests/hindsight-client.test.ts`:

- Every method arms an `AbortController` with `timeoutMs` (default 1500); an abort surfaces as
  `HindsightError{ kind: "timeout" }` thrown **within budget**.
- Non-2xx ⇒ `HindsightError{ kind: "http", status }`; DNS/connection/socket failure ⇒
  `HindsightError{ kind: "network" }`.
- The `Authorization: Bearer` header is sent **only when `apiKey` is set**.
- `health()` is the sole exception that swallows errors — it is a pure reachability probe mapping
  every failure to `{ ok: false }`. Dormancy and skip-on-failure are the **provider's** job, so the
  client surface stays a faithful mapping.

## Testing

| Test | Phase | What it pins |
|---|---|---|
| `tests/hindsight-client.test.ts` | unit | Client round-trips, typed errors, timeout-within-budget, auth-header-only-when-set, namespace path-building (vs the in-process stub). |
| `tests/hindsight-provider.test.ts` | unit | Dormancy (no URL ⇒ no client constructed), auto-tag taxonomy, `recallScope` filter, retry-queue retry + cap, block shape. |
| `tests/e2e/hindsight-external.spec.ts` | E2E | sessionSetup + beforePrompt blocks appear; a turn retains on the stub with bank `bobbit` + correct tags; unhealthy ⇒ session unaffected + diagnostic + `status` unhealthy; recovery flushes the queue; per-project disable ⇒ no injection; persists across reload. |
| `tests/manual-integration/hindsight-external.test.ts` | manual | Real local Hindsight round-trip. |

The shared in-process stub `tests/e2e/hindsight-stub.mjs` (`startHindsightStub`) backs the
automated tests deterministically — no network. It records every call, serves seeded memories
filtered by request tags, records retained items, and `setHealthy(false)` flips `/health` to 503 so
the provider's skip/queue paths are exercised.

### Manual integration against a real Hindsight

`tests/manual-integration/hindsight-external.test.ts` talks directly to a running Hindsight over
HTTP (no Bobbit gateway) and exercises `ensureBank → retain → recall`, polling up to ~30 s to
tolerate Hindsight's asynchronous fact-extraction pipeline. It **skips cleanly** (never fails) when
the health probe shows Hindsight is unreachable, so the manual suite stays green on machines
without a local Hindsight.

Environment:

| Var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `HINDSIGHT_URL` | `http://localhost:8888` | Base URL of the running Hindsight. |
| `HINDSIGHT_NS` | `default` | Namespace path segment. |
| `HINDSIGHT_BANK` | `bobbit-it` | **Dedicated** bank id so the test never pollutes the shared production `bobbit` bank. |
| `HINDSIGHT_API_KEY` | — | Optional bearer token; sent only when set. |

```bash
npm run build && node --import tsx --test tests/manual-integration/hindsight-external.test.ts
```

## Build & packaging

The pack is built like any [first-party pack](marketplace.md#built-in-first-party-packs): the three
server modules (`hindsight-client`, `provider`, `routes`) are hand-authored TS bundled to
confined-worker Node ESM under `lib/*.mjs` by `scripts/build-market-packs.mjs` (the `hindsight`
entry in `PACKS`, `platform: "node"`), and `scripts/copy-builtin-packs.mjs` lists `"hindsight"` in
`FIRST_PARTY_PACKS` so it ships in the built-in band. The shared `src/shared.ts` is inlined into
both `provider.mjs` and `routes.mjs`; only `lib/` ships, never `src/`.

## Non-goals

Tracked in later Extension Platform goals, **not** in this release:

- Explicit agent tools `hindsight_recall/retain/reflect`, the native memory panel, and entry
  points — **G2.3**.
- Managed Docker runtime + Postgres + `~/.hindsight` bind-mount + deployment-mode selection
  (`mode: managed`) — **G3**.
- Mental-models / reflect UI / cross-engine dedupe / cost surfacing — **G4**.
