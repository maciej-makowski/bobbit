# `deferOffscreenRender` — defer off-screen transcript render

Default-on perf optimisation. Cuts paint cost when activating a session with a
long transcript by rendering only the bottom-tail eagerly and deferring the
rest behind an `IntersectionObserver`.

## Why

Auto-scroll-to-bottom on session activation puts the user at the *latest*
message of the transcript. On a 1280×800 desktop only ~3 messages are
visible at first paint, but the historical render path parsed and rendered
every message synchronously — including 100KB+ tool-result blobs scrolled
far above the viewport. Sidebar navigation into long sessions felt
sluggish because the browser blocked on rendering content the user could
not yet see.

## How it works

`src/ui/components/MessageList.ts` wraps each transcript message in
`<deferred-block>` (`src/ui/components/DeferredBlock.ts`):

- The last `DEFER_EAGER_TAIL = 8` messages render synchronously. This
  covers the visible viewport on a typical desktop with a small headroom
  for the next scroll-up gesture.
- Older messages render a height-preserving placeholder (cheap text
  approximation of the rendered height). The DOM is approximately-sized at
  first paint so scrollbar position is stable.
- Each placeholder observes itself with `IntersectionObserver(rootMargin:
  2000px)` and swaps in the real content via `requestIdleCallback({
  timeout: 50 })` (with `setTimeout(0)` fallback) when it approaches the
  viewport. The larger rootMargin pre-resolves blocks well before they
  scroll into view to hide the swap latency.
- If the measured real height differs from the placeholder estimate, the
  block preserves the scroll anchor for content above the viewport so
  loading older history does not visibly push the current reading position.

## Correctness escape hatch

Native browser-find (`Ctrl+F` / `Cmd+F` / `F3`) does not trigger
`IntersectionObserver`, so a naive deferred-render would let users search a
transcript that is mostly placeholders. A module-level keydown listener
captures those keys at the *capture* phase and calls
`DeferredBlock.forceResolveAll()` synchronously, replacing every
placeholder with the real content before the browser's find UI runs.

The same `forceResolveAll()` is exposed via `window.DeferredBlock` for
external consumers (e.g. test code that snapshots the transcript DOM).

## How to disable

Per-user opt-out:

```js
localStorage.setItem("bobbitPerfFlags", "-deferOffscreenRender");
```

Reload the page (the flag is read once at module load). The historical
synchronous render path is restored byte-for-byte.

## When to remove the flag entirely

This flag is a measurement / kill-switch artefact, not a permanent toggle.
Remove it (and the `isPerfFlagEnabled` branch in `MessageList.ts`) once we
have confidence the optimisation is correct in the field. Long-lived feature
flags accumulate configuration sprawl.

## Verification

Behaviour is pinned by:

- `tests/defer-offscreen-render.spec.ts` — eager path, deferred
  placeholder, IntersectionObserver promotion, scroll-anchor preservation,
  `Ctrl+F` force-resolve, flag-off zero wrappers, flag-on eager / placeholder
  split, edge case where N messages ≤ `DEFER_EAGER_TAIL`.
- `tests/e2e/ui/transcript-fidelity.spec.ts` — the canonical correctness
  test. Asserts the live streaming DOM equals the post-refresh DOM after
  multi-cycle streaming bursts; calls `DeferredBlock.forceResolveAll()`
  before each DOM snapshot so placeholders do not mask content drift.

## Measured impact (large transcript fixture, n=5 replicates per arm)

Every ON-arm sample beats every OFF-arm sample on the headline spans —
non-overlapping replicate ranges:

- `paint.first` p95: 113.5 ms → 76.5 ms (**−37 ms / −33%**)
- `nav.session.ready` p95: 330.4 ms → 235.4 ms (**−95 ms / −29%**)
- rapid Ctrl+↓ keystroke p95: 320.3 ms → 217.9 ms (**−102 ms / −32%**)
- rapid Ctrl+↓ inter-keystroke gap p50: 109.2 ms → 41.7 ms (**crosses
  the 100 ms snappy threshold**)

The user-facing meaning is the rapid-keystroke gap p50: walking the
sidebar with held-down Ctrl+↓ now feels smooth because the main thread
frees up between keystrokes well within budget.

Detailed methodology and the postmortems for other optimisations that
*did not* clear the decision rule live on a parked follow-up branch (the
investigation evidence trail).
