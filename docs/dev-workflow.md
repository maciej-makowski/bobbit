# Development Workflow

How to run, develop, and deploy Bobbit. For project architecture and concepts see [README.md](../README.md). For agent-facing context (repo layout, key abstractions, common tasks) see [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md).

---

## Running modes

Bobbit has three runtime modes: **production**, **dev**, and **dev with harness**. The difference is how server-side TypeScript is compiled and how the UI is served.

### Production

```bash
npm run build   # compile server + bundle UI
npm start       # serve everything from dist/
```

The gateway serves the bundled UI from `dist/ui/` as static files. Everything runs from a single process (plus agent child processes). No hot reload — you must rebuild and restart to pick up changes.

### Dev (no harness)

```bash
npm run build:server   # required once before first run
npm run dev            # gateway + vite dev server
```

Runs two processes concurrently:

1. **Gateway** (`node dist/server/cli.js --cwd . --no-ui`) on port 3001 — handles REST API, WebSocket, and agent subprocesses.
2. **Vite** on port 5173 — serves the UI with hot module replacement. Proxies `/api` and `/ws` to the gateway.

UI changes (`src/ui/`, `src/app/`) hot-reload instantly in the browser. Server changes (`src/server/`) require manually rebuilding (`npm run build:server`) and restarting the gateway.

### Dev with harness (recommended)

```bash
npm run dev:harness
```

Same two-process setup, but the gateway is wrapped in a **restart harness** (`src/server/harness.ts`). The harness:

- Watches a sentinel file at `.bobbit/state/gateway-restart`
- On signal: kills the server, waits for the port to free, **self-heals `node_modules`** (see below), runs `npm run build:server`, relaunches
- Auto-restarts on unexpected crashes
- On every boot/restart it checks that each declared dependency is physically present in `node_modules` and, only if some are missing, runs a non-destructive `npm install` to restore them (a healthy tree is a no-op)
- Sessions survive restarts (persisted to `.bobbit/state/sessions.json`)

To trigger a restart:

```bash
npm run restart-server
```

This touches the sentinel file. The harness picks it up within ~500ms (polled on Windows, `fs.watch` elsewhere) and begins the restart cycle.

When the gateway was launched by this harness, the Settings page also shows a top-right **Restart Server** button. The button is hidden in production and in `npm run dev` because those modes do not set `BOBBIT_DEV_HARNESS=1` and cannot be restarted safely by the harness. Clicking it calls `POST /api/harness/restart`, which is server-gated and touches the same `.bobbit/state/gateway-restart` sentinel as `npm run restart-server`.

---

## What changes require what

| What you changed | What to do |
|---|---|
| `src/ui/**` or `src/app/**` | Nothing — Vite hot-reloads automatically |
| `src/server/**` | Run `npm run restart-server` (if using harness) or manually `npm run build:server` + restart |
| `package.json` (new dependency) | `npm install`, then restart server |
| `vite.config.ts` | Restart Vite (kill and re-run `npm run dev:harness`) |
| `tsconfig.*.json` | Restart server; may need to restart Vite for web config changes |
| `.bobbit/config/system-prompt.md` | Restart server (the path is resolved at startup and passed to agents) |

**Rule of thumb**: UI is hot. Server is compiled. If you touched anything under `src/server/`, you need a rebuild + restart.

---

## `node_modules` gets wiped while the dev server is running

**Symptom**: the app suddenly stops functioning and the gateway logs
`ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND: Cannot find package '@earendil-works/pi-ai'` (or another
core dependency) — even though `package.json` and `package-lock.json` still list
it. Often appears right after running `npm audit fix --force`, `npm ci`, or
`npm install --force`.

**Cause**: a running dev stack (vite, the gateway) loads native `.node` addons
into memory — e.g. `lightningcss.win32-x64-msvc.node`,
`@mariozechner/clipboard-*`, `photon-node`. On Windows you cannot `unlink` a
native module file while a process has it loaded. A *destructive* npm operation
wipes and rewrites `node_modules`; it removes additive deps as planned, then
aborts with `EPERM` the instant it tries to unlink the locked native binary —
leaving `node_modules` half-wiped with core runtime packages missing.

**Avoid**: never run `npm ci`, `npm install --force`, or `npm audit fix --force`
while the dev stack (`npm run dev:harness` / vite) is up. Stop it first, run the
destructive command, then restart.

**Recover**: a plain `npm install` is *additive* — it does not pre-wipe, so it
restores the missing packages around any locked file. The harness now does this
automatically on every boot/restart (`ensureDeps()` in `src/server/harness.ts`,
backed by the pure `missingDependencies()` helper in
`src/server/harness-deps.ts`); if the install itself fails because a native file
is still locked, stop vite/the gateway and run `npm install` by hand.

## For agents making changes

If you are an AI agent running inside a Bobbit session and you are modifying Bobbit itself:

### UI changes — no action needed

Edit files under `src/ui/` or `src/app/`. Vite picks up the changes and hot-reloads the browser. The user sees updates within seconds. No restart, no build command.

### Server changes — trigger a restart

After editing files under `src/server/`:

```bash
npm run restart-server
```

This signals the harness to rebuild and restart the server. Your current session will survive — the harness persists session metadata to disk, and on relaunch the server restores all sessions from `.bobbit/state/sessions.json`.

**Do not skip this step.** The gateway runs from compiled JavaScript in `dist/server/`. Your TypeScript edits under `src/server/` have no effect until the server is rebuilt.

### Verify your changes compiled

After `npm run restart-server`, watch for the harness output:

```
[harness] ======== RESTART TRIGGERED ========
[harness] Waiting for port 3001 to be free...
[harness] Building server...
[harness] Build complete.
[harness] Launching server (port 3001)...
```

If the build fails, the harness logs the error and attempts to launch the old build anyway. Fix the compilation error and run `npm run restart-server` again.

### Type-checking without restarting

To check both server and UI types without emitting or restarting:

```bash
npm run check
```

This runs `tsc --noEmit` against both `tsconfig.server.json` and `tsconfig.web.json`. Useful to catch errors before triggering a restart.

### Adding new files

New files under `src/server/` are automatically picked up by the next `npm run build:server` (triggered by the harness). No extra configuration needed — the TypeScript config includes all `.ts` files under `src/server/`.

New UI files need to be imported somewhere in the dependency graph (from `src/app/main.ts` or an existing component). Vite handles the rest.

---

## Build outputs

```
dist/
├── server/         # tsc output from src/server/ (Node16 ESM)
│   ├── cli.js      # gateway entry point
│   ├── harness.js  # dev server harness
│   └── agent/      # session manager, RPC bridge, stores
└── ui/             # vite bundle from src/ui/ + src/app/
    ├── index.html  # SPA entry
    └── assets/     # JS, CSS, fonts
```

Two independent build pipelines:

- **Server**: `tsc -p tsconfig.server.json` → `dist/server/`. Plain TypeScript compilation, no bundling.
- **UI**: `vite build` → `dist/ui/`. Bundles, minifies, tree-shakes. In dev mode, Vite serves directly from source with HMR.

---

## Networking architecture

Bobbit is designed for **remote access over a NordVPN mesh network**. The user runs the server on a dev machine and connects from other devices (laptop, tablet) via a mesh IP or a custom domain.

### Port topology (dev mode)

```
Browser (ProArt / phone / etc.)
  │
  │  https://yourname.dedyn.io:5173   ← user-facing URL
  │
  ▼
Vite dev server (:5173)             ← serves UI with HMR, HTTPS using gateway cert
  │  proxy /api/* ──────────────►  Gateway (:3001)  ← REST API + agent management
  │  proxy /ws/*  ──────────────►  Gateway (:3001)  ← WebSocket (session streaming)
  │
  └─ HMR websocket (:5173)         ← Vite's own hot-reload channel (same port)
```

In **production mode** (`npm start`), there is no Vite — the gateway serves the bundled UI directly on port 3001.

### Host binding

Both the gateway and Vite auto-detect the **NordLynx** (NordVPN mesh) interface IP and bind to it.

- **Gateway**: exits with an error if NordLynx isn't found, unless you pass `--host <addr>`
- **Vite**: falls back to `localhost` with a warning, or uses `VITE_HOST` env var

The detected mesh IP (e.g. `<mesh-ip>`) is what other mesh devices use to reach the server.

### deSEC dynamic DNS

On startup, the gateway updates a **deSEC** (dedyn.io) DNS A record so that `yourname.dedyn.io` points to the current mesh IP. Config lives at `.bobbit/state/desec.json`:

```json
{ "domain": "yourname.dedyn.io", "token": "<deSEC API token>" }
```

This means the user can always access `https://yourname.dedyn.io:5173` (dev) or `https://yourname.dedyn.io:3001` (prod) without memorizing mesh IPs, even when the IP changes across NordVPN reconnects.

**Important**: The deSEC update is skipped for loopback addresses (`127.0.0.1`, `::1`, `localhost`) to prevent E2E tests or local-only runs from clobbering the DNS record. If DNS points to `127.0.0.1`, a prior server start with `--host 127.0.0.1` likely caused it — restart the server normally (without `--host`) to push the correct mesh IP.

### TLS certificates

TLS is **on by default**. The server generates certificates on first run and stores them at:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `.bobbit/state/tls/cert.pem` | Server certificate (covers the host IP + `localhost`) |
| `.bobbit/state/tls/key.pem` | Server private key |
| `.bobbit/state/tls/ca.crt` | Local CA certificate (install on other devices to trust) |
| `.bobbit/state/tls/ca.key` | Local CA private key |

The cert is generated via **mkcert** (npm package) signed by the local CA, with fallback to openssl self-signed. Vite reuses the same cert/key for its HTTPS server (`vite.config.ts` reads them from disk).

To trust the cert on a remote device, install `.bobbit/state/tls/ca.crt` as a trusted CA.

If the cert doesn't cover the current host (e.g. the mesh IP changed), it is regenerated automatically on next startup.

### Troubleshooting connectivity

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` on `:5173` | Vite not running, or not bound to mesh IP | Check `npm run dev:harness` output; verify NordVPN is connected |
| `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` on `:3001` | Gateway not running | Same as above |
| WebSocket connects but session fails | Browser has wrong gateway URL in `localStorage` | Open DevTools console: `localStorage.getItem("gw-url")` — should match the gateway's actual address. Fix with `localStorage.setItem("gw-url", "<correct URL>")` and reload |
| DNS resolves to `127.0.0.1` | A prior `--host 127.0.0.1` run (e.g. E2E tests) pushed loopback to deSEC | Restart the server normally — it will push the mesh IP to deSEC. Flush DNS on the client device if cached |
| Vite HMR WebSocket error in console | Normal when accessing via domain/mesh IP — Vite's HMR can't always connect back | Harmless. Vite falls back to polling. The "Direct websocket connection fallback" message confirms this |
| `ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID` | Remote device doesn't trust the local CA | Install `.bobbit/state/tls/ca.crt` on the device, or click through the browser warning |

### Local-only development (no NordVPN)

```bash
# Terminal 1: gateway on localhost
node dist/server/cli.js --host localhost --port 3001 --cwd . --no-ui --no-tls

# Terminal 2: vite on localhost
GATEWAY_NO_TLS=1 VITE_HOST=localhost npx vite
```

Or use the E2E test config which does this automatically:

```bash
npx playwright test --config playwright-e2e.config.ts
```

---

## Testing

```bash
npm test              # All tests (unit + E2E)
npm run test:unit     # Unit tests — Node test runner + Playwright file:// fixtures
npm run test:e2e      # E2E tests — API (in-process) + browser (spawned gateway)
```

E2E tests use `playwright-e2e.config.ts` which defines two projects:

- **`api`** (4 workers): API-only tests import from `in-process-harness.js` — the gateway runs in the same Node process, eliminating child process spawn overhead. Covers HTTP/WS API tests, CRUD, agent protocol.
- **`browser`** (2 workers): Browser and process-level tests import from `gateway-harness.js` — spawns a real gateway child process. Used for UI E2E tests (`tests/e2e/ui/`), MCP integration, and tests needing process-level behavior (port allocation, auth bypass).

See [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md#testing) for harness selection guidance and test recipes.

---

## Continuous Integration (CI)

CI is **PR validation only** — there is no CD, publish, or release automation here (releases are cut manually via the `release` skill). The workflow lives at [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) and exists to give every pull request a fast, deterministic quality gate before it reaches `master`.

**Triggers.** Runs on `pull_request` targeting `master` and on `push` to `master`. A `concurrency` group keyed on the ref with `cancel-in-progress: true` supersedes stale runs — pushing a new commit to a PR cancels the previous in-flight run rather than queuing both, so the latest commit always gets the freshest result.

**Why separate jobs.** Each check is its own job (not sequential steps in one job) so that a failure in one is independently visible on the PR and does not mask the others. You can see at a glance whether it was types, dead code, or tests that broke.

| Job | Command | What it catches |
|---|---|---|
| `typecheck` | `npm run check` | Type errors across server (`tsconfig.server.json`) and web (`tsconfig.web.json`) |
| `knip` | `npx knip` | Unused files, exports, and dependencies (config: `knip.config.ts`; no npm script — invoked directly) |
| `unit` | `npm run test:unit` | Node test-runner suite + Playwright `file://` component fixtures |

The browser/API **E2E suite is not part of per-PR CI** — it runs as a separate, manually-triggered workflow (see [E2E workflow](#e2e-a-separate-manually-triggered-workflow) below).

### Runner environment

- **Runner**: `ubuntu-latest`. No Docker — the only Docker-*requiring* E2E specs (`sandbox-recovery-docker*`) are already excluded by `playwright-e2e.config.ts`, and `sandbox-pentest.spec.ts` only exercises the sandbox arg builder.
- **Node**: 22, via `actions/setup-node` with `cache: npm` (the repo's `engines` field requires `>=22.19.0`).
- **Install**: `npm ci` against the committed lockfile for reproducible installs.
- **Playwright Chromium**: both `test:unit` and `test:e2e` drive Chromium, so those jobs run `npx playwright install --with-deps chromium` and cache `~/.cache/ms-playwright` keyed on the resolved Playwright version (cache hits skip the multi-minute browser download).
- **Git identity**: the `unit` and `e2e` jobs set a `bobbit-ci` `user.name`/`user.email` before running, because the suites exercise real git operations (worktrees, commits) that fail on a runner with no configured identity.

Each job is self-contained and builds what it needs: `test:e2e` runs a full `npm run build`, and `test:unit` auto-builds the server if it is missing. CI is detected automatically — GitHub sets `CI=true`, which the Playwright configs already key off (unit → 2 workers; E2E → `retries: 3`), so no extra configuration is needed.

### Intentionally excluded

CI deliberately does **not** run:

- **The `test:manual` tier** — real agents, Docker, and live LLM API keys (`npm run test:manual`). It needs credentials and ~5 minutes of wall-clock; it stays a local/manual step.
- **Docker-only E2E** — `sandbox-recovery-docker*` specs, already ignored by `playwright-e2e.config.ts`.
- **Linters and formatters** — no eslint, prettier, or any new linter was added for CI. `knip` is the only static-analysis gate.
- **Pre-commit hooks** — no husky or git hooks were introduced.
- **CD** — no npm publish, binary sub-packages, or GitHub releases; those remain owned by the `release` skill.

### Required checks

Branch protection on `origin/master` marks **`typecheck`, `knip`, and `unit`** as required status checks (`strict: true`) — a PR cannot merge until all three are green and the branch is up to date with `master`.

> **Sequencing note for whoever changes the required checks.** A required-status-check name must exactly match a context GitHub has actually reported. Let the workflow run once on a real PR first, confirm the reported job names (`typecheck`, `knip`, `unit`), then add the required contexts — otherwise protection blocks every PR waiting on a check that has never reported.

### E2E — a separate, manually-triggered workflow

The browser/API E2E suite lives in its **own** workflow, [`.github/workflows/e2e.yml`](../.github/workflows/e2e.yml), triggered **only** by `workflow_dispatch` — it does **not** run automatically on PRs or pushes. Run it on demand:

- **GitHub UI**: Actions → **E2E** → **Run workflow** (pick the branch/ref).
- **CLI**: `gh workflow run e2e.yml --ref <branch>`.

The job mirrors the old per-PR e2e job (ubuntu-latest, Node 22, `npm ci`, git identity, cached Playwright Chromium, `npm run test:e2e`).

**Why it's separate.** The E2E suite has a pre-existing flake floor (FS-contention races and goal-assistant cold-start timeouts, partly tracked via `@quarantine`-tagged specs) that `playwright-e2e.config.ts` absorbs with `retries: 3` but does not fully eliminate. Running it per-PR — even non-blocking — produced noisy intermittent reds, so it is gated behind a manual trigger: run it before a risky merge or when touching E2E-covered surfaces, rather than on every PR.

**Follow-up (not the end state).** Stabilize the flake floor (fix the underlying races, exclude/retire the `@quarantine` tags, tighten `retries` back toward 0), then fold E2E back into per-PR CI — ideally as a required check.

## Worktree branch namespaces

When you list `git branch` in a Bobbit-managed repo you'll see several namespaces:

| Prefix | Owner | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `pool/_pool-<id>` | Worktree pool | Pre-built worktrees waiting to be claimed by a session or goal. Renamed atomically on claim. (Pre-Phase 3 these used `session/_pool-*`; both prefixes are recognised on startup for back-compat.) |
| `session/<id8>` | Live regular session | A session worktree, named immediately on pool claim (no first-prompt rename). Cleaned up on session archive. See [internals.md — Session worktrees](internals.md#session-worktrees) and [design/remove-session-worktree-rename.md](design/remove-session-worktree-rename.md). |
| `goal/<slug>-<id>` | Live goal | Spans every component repo in multi-repo projects. |
| `goal/<goalId8>/<role>-<short4>` | Team-member agent | Per-role worktree under a live goal. Created on `team_spawn`, cleaned up on goal archive (alongside the goal branch) or agent dismiss. Legacy `goal-goal-<slug>-<id>-<role>-<short>` from before the `pithier-te` rename is recognised by the same cleanup path. |
| `staff-<name>-<id>` | Staff agent worktree | Long-lived when the staff uses a worktree; rebased onto the primary branch/base ref on each wake. No-worktree staff have no staff branch. |

The boot sweeper (`worktree-sweeper.ts`) reconciles these against persisted state on every server start — orphaned pool entries and renamed-but-unpersisted worktrees are cleaned up automatically. See [internals.md — Session worktrees](internals.md#session-worktrees) for the full lifecycle.

**Base ref for new worktrees.** New worktrees (session, goal, staff, pool) branch off the project's configured `base_ref` when set, otherwise off the remote primary (`origin/master`/`origin/main`). The same value drives the `{{baseBranch}}` workflow variable and the `aheadOfPrimary`/`behindPrimary` git-status comparator. Some worktrees also use it as `@{u}` for local status, but Bobbit-owned branch publication never relies on upstream tracking: it pushes explicit destination refspecs such as `<branch>:refs/heads/<branch>` or `HEAD:refs/heads/<branch>`. `{{master}}` keeps resolving to the project primary independently. Team-member worktrees branch off the goal branch by hierarchical design and are not affected. Full semantics, validation rules, and error inventory: [design/base-ref.md](design/base-ref.md).

### Worktree-stash hazard — never `git stash` inside a session worktree

**The hazard.** All worktrees of one repo share a single `.git` directory — including its stash stack. `git stash` in worktree A pushes onto the same stack that `git stash pop` in worktree B reads from. When multiple agents work on the same project in parallel (the normal team-goal case), an unscoped `stash` / `stash pop` pair in one worktree silently drags another worktree's uncommitted changes into the wrong branch. The receiving agent ends up with files it never wrote (and tests it wasn't expecting to pass), and the originating agent loses its work to a dangling stash entry that the next `stash pop` somewhere will accidentally apply.

This is not a Bobbit bug — it's a git behaviour. There is no per-worktree stash stack. **Treat `git stash` as unsafe inside any goal / session / team-member / staff worktree.**

**What hit us.** During the *Human Sign-Off Gates* goal, three parallel coder agents ran in sibling worktrees (`coder-abe0`, `coder-b42b`, `coder-933c`). One agent ran `git stash` to test a clean tree, another ran `git stash pop` shortly afterwards — and Track C's WIP landed on Track A's branch. The team lead had to inventory all three worktrees by hand, swap files back to their rightful branches, and restart two of the three tracks. Several hours lost.

**Safe alternatives.**

- **Commit instead of stash.** Make a throwaway WIP commit (`git commit -am wip`), do the experiment, then `git reset HEAD~1` (or amend) to restore the working state. The commit object stays scoped to the branch you're on.
- **`git worktree add` a fresh temporary worktree** if you genuinely need a clean copy of the tree at a specific ref. Each worktree gets its own working copy with no stash interaction.
- **`git diff > patch && git checkout .`** to save changes to a file, then `git apply patch` later. The patch file is a local artefact — no shared `.git` state involved.

**If you must stash anyway**, pass `--include-untracked` and immediately pop in the same worktree before any other operation — do not leave entries on the stack that another agent could later pop by accident. The first `git stash list` from any sibling worktree will show the entries you created.

**Diagnostic when this regresses.** `git status` in a worktree shows files you never edited, often touching paths that match another in-progress task. `git reflog show stash` lists every entry on the shared stack with its `WIP on <branch>` annotation — entries from a different branch than the worktree you're in are the smoking gun. Reconstruct by walking `git stash show -p stash@{N}` for each entry and applying to the correct worktree manually.

## Working with forks

This repository is itself a **fork**: `origin` is `maciej-makowski/bobbit`, `upstream` is `SuuBro/bobbit`. The general procedure — remote setup, the merge-commit rule, healing a squashed sync, and contributing changes back — lives in [Maintaining a fork](#maintaining-a-fork) below. Fork-specific notes:

- A scheduled maintenance agent opens the `[upstream-sync] …` PRs automatically; you can also run the same procedure by hand.
- Merge commits are enabled on this fork (`allow_merge_commit = true`) and linear history is not required — so upstream-sync PRs can (and must) be merged with "Create a merge commit".
- Day-to-day PRs target `origin/master`; changes intended for the source project target `SuuBro/bobbit`'s `master`.

## Maintaining a fork

Bobbit can be run as a downstream **fork** that carries local customisations while tracking this repository for upstream changes. The conventions below keep that sustainable in both directions. Set up two remotes in your fork's clone:

| Remote | Points at | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `origin` | your fork (e.g. `<you>/bobbit`) | Your fork. Day-to-day PRs target its `master`. |
| `upstream` | the repository you forked from | The source you track for new commits. |

Add it once with `git remote add upstream <url>`; confirm with `git remote -v`. Targeting the wrong base sends review traffic to a repo you may not control — always verify the PR base before creating it.

### Syncing changes *from* upstream

Pull new `upstream/master` commits into your fork through a single review-ready PR (some forks automate this with a scheduled job, titled e.g. `[upstream-sync] …`):

1. `git fetch upstream && git fetch origin`.
2. Stop if `git rev-list --count origin/master..upstream/master` is `0` — nothing new.
3. `git switch -c sync/upstream-<date> origin/master`.
4. `git merge --no-ff upstream/master`, resolve conflicts so your fork-specific behaviour is preserved, validate (`npm run check` + tests), push, open the PR.

**⚠️ Merge-commit rule.** **Merge upstream-sync PRs with a real merge commit — never squash, never rebase.**

- Squash/rebase **discards the merge's second parent**, so git loses all record that upstream's commits already live in your `master`. After that, `git merge-base master upstream/master` stays pinned at an ancient commit, `origin/master..upstream/master` re-counts every already-merged commit as "ahead", and the next sync re-litigates conflicts you already resolved.
- A merge commit keeps `upstream/master` as a true parent, so future syncs surface **only** genuinely-new commits.
- Enable merge commits on your fork (`allow_merge_commit = true`) and don't require linear history; then use "Create a merge commit" / `gh pr merge <n> --merge`. (If the GitHub UI hides the option right after you change the setting, hard-refresh the PR page — the merge dropdown is cached at load time.)

**If a sync PR was squashed by mistake.** You can't rewrite a protected `master`, so heal the ancestry *forward*: branch off the current `master`, build a commit that records `upstream/master` as a second parent while keeping `master`'s tree, then merge that PR with a merge commit:

```bash
git switch -c sync/heal origin/master
git cherry-pick <new-upstream-commits>          # land any new upstream content cleanly
TREE=$(git write-tree)
HEAL=$(git commit-tree "$TREE" -p origin/master -p upstream/master -m "Merge upstream/master (heal ancestry)")
git reset --hard "$HEAL"                         # branch tip = merge commit, tree = master + new content
# push, open PR, then: gh pr merge <n> --merge   (NEVER squash)
```

### Contributing changes back upstream

To get a fork change accepted into the upstream project:

1. **Develop upstreamable work on a branch cut from `upstream/master`, not your fork's `master`.** A branch based on upstream produces a PR containing *only* your change — no fork-specific commits (CI tweaks, local config, …) leak in.
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git switch -c feature/<name> upstream/master
   # build the change in focused, self-contained commits
   git push origin feature/<name>
   gh pr create --repo <upstream-owner>/bobbit --base master --head <you>:feature/<name>
   ```
2. **Land it in both places.** Merge the branch into your fork (fork PR) and submit it upstream. Once upstream accepts it, the next sync brings it back as a normal ancestor — no duplication, no conflict.
3. **Extracting a change that currently lives only in your fork.** Cherry-pick just its commits onto a fresh `upstream/master`-based branch, dropping fork-only adaptations, and open the upstream PR from there.
4. **Keep fork divergence minimal.** Every file your fork edits that upstream also maintains becomes a recurring merge conflict. Prefer additive, isolated changes (new files, local config) over editing files upstream actively changes. The smaller and more separable the divergence, the cheaper both syncing-down and contributing-up become.
