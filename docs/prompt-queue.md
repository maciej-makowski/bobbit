# Prompt Queue & Message Dispatch

How user messages flow from the browser to the agent subprocess, how they queue when the agent is busy, and how the UI keeps in sync.

## Architecture overview

```

                     └─ broadcastQueue() ──WS──► queue_update

  steer()  ──WS──►  (streaming?) ──► rpcClient.steer() ──► injected mid-turn
```

## Three dispatch paths

### 1. Direct dispatch (idle + empty queue)

The fast path. Agent is idle and nothing is queued — the prompt goes straight to the agent subprocess via `rpcClient.prompt()`. Title generation also fires here for the first message.

### 2. Enqueue (busy or queue non-empty)

Agent is streaming or the queue already has items. The message is added to `PromptQueue`, and a `queue_update` is broadcast to all connected clients so the UI can show the pending messages. If the agent happens to be idle (queue was non-empty), `drainQueue()` is called immediately.

### 3. Drain (agent becomes idle)

On `agent_end`, if the queue has items and the turn didn't end with an error, `drainQueue()` dispatches the next work. If steered messages are at the front of the queue, they are all popped as a batch via `dequeueAllSteered()` and concatenated (`\n`-joined) into a single prompt — this ensures multiple steered messages arrive as one coherent block rather than triggering separate agent turns. Otherwise, the next undispatched message is popped and sent via `rpcClient.prompt()`. Status is set to `"streaming"` optimistically to prevent a race where another `enqueuePrompt()` call sees idle+empty and dispatches a second concurrent prompt.

## Message types

### `prompt` (client → server)

Standard user message. Always routed through `enqueuePrompt()` — never sent directly to the agent.

### `steer` (client → server)

A mid-turn redirect. Behavior depends on agent state:

- **Agent streaming**: Dispatched **immediately** via `rpcClient.steer()` — injected between tool calls in real-time. The message is NOT queued. The UI textarea always queues via `prompt` — it never sends `steer` directly.
- **Agent idle**: Enqueued as a steered message. Steered messages sort before normal messages in the queue.

### `follow_up` (client → server)

Similar to `prompt` but dispatched via `rpcClient.followUp()` instead of `rpcClient.prompt()`. Used when continuing a conversation after the agent finished (different RPC semantics in the agent subprocess). Routed through `enqueuePrompt()` like normal prompts. The `isFollowUp` flag is preserved on the `QueuedMessage` so that queued follow-ups dispatch via the correct RPC method on drain.

### `steer_queued` (client → server)

Promotes an already-queued message to steered priority. The steered message is reordered to the front and shows a "Sent" badge in the UI. Steered messages are **not** dispatched immediately by `steer_queued` — promotion just sets `isSteered=true` and broadcasts. The next `tool_execution_end` event (or `agent_end` as a safety net for non-tool turns) drains all consecutive steered rows from the front of the queue via `dequeueAllSteered()` and hands them to the single `_dispatchSteer()` site, which removes the rows, joins them with `\n`, and forwards to `rpcClient.steer()`. While the agent is parked inside `bash_bg wait`, `steerQueued` still calls `bgProcessManager.abortAllWaits()` so the wait resolves and a tool boundary actually arrives. If the agent is force-killed before any boundary, the row is still in `promptQueue` and `drainQueue()` picks it up after respawn.

### `remove_queued` (client → server)

Removes a message from the queue. Broadcasts an updated queue.

### `reorder_queue` (client → server)

Reorders the queue to match a given array of message IDs. Unknown IDs are ignored; messages not listed are appended at the end. Broadcasts updated queue. Used by the drag-to-reorder UI on queue pills.

### `queue_update` (server → client)

Sent whenever the queue changes — enqueue, dequeue, steer, remove, reorder. Contains the full queue array so clients can replace their local state.

## PromptQueue internals

`src/server/agent/prompt-queue.ts` — a per-session ordered queue with priority sorting.

**Ordering**: Steered messages always sort before non-steered. Within each group, insertion order is preserved (stable sort). The client can explicitly reorder via `reorder(messageIds)` — the queue adopts the given ID order, with unlisted items appended at the end.

**Lifetime is queued → dispatched (= removed).** A row is added by `enqueue()` and is removed exactly once: either by `_dispatchSteer()` immediately *before* it awaits `rpcClient.steer()` (steered batch dispatch), by `drainQueue()` when the agent goes idle (regular dispatch), or by an explicit `remove()` from the UI. The queue **does not** carry an in-flight `dispatched` flag — once the SDK has the text, the SDK's `_steeringMessages` mirror (and Bobbit's shadow ledger; see [Abort and force-kill recovery](#abort-and-force-kill-recovery)) own that state. `enqueueAtFront()` is reserved for reconciliation paths that need to put a row back at index 0 after an RPC failure or post-abort drain.

Why this matters: the previous design carried a `dispatched: true` flag on rows after dispatch and relied on `removeDispatched()` / `resetDispatched()` to maintain it across normal completion vs force-kill. Three independent caches of "what's pending" — Bobbit's flag, the SDK's `_steeringMessages`, and pi-agent-core's `Agent.steeringQueue` — drifted under abort/restart and produced duplicate-steer-on-Stop. Removing the flag and treating row-removal-on-dispatch as the single source of truth at the Bobbit layer eliminates the drift. See [docs/design/steer-subsystem-rewrite.md](design/steer-subsystem-rewrite.md) for the design rationale.

**follow_up preservation**: `QueuedMessage` carries an optional `isFollowUp` flag. When set, `drainQueue()` dispatches via `rpcClient.followUp()` instead of `rpcClient.prompt()`, preserving the correct RPC semantics through the queue.

**Persistence**: The queue is persisted to `.bobbit/state/sessions.json` (via `SessionStore.update`) on every mutation, and restored on server restart via `new PromptQueue(ps.messageQueue)`.

## Client-side rendering

`src/app/remote-agent.ts` handles the UI side:

### Optimistic user messages

When the user sends a prompt and the agent is **idle** (`!isStreaming`), `RemoteAgent.prompt()` adds the message to `state.messages` immediately with an `optimistic_*` id prefix. This ensures the message appears in chat without waiting for the server echo.

When the agent is **streaming**, the message is queued — no optimistic message is added. The server will echo it in the correct interleaved position when the queue drains and the agent processes it. The message appears as a queue pill above the textarea so the user knows it's pending.

### Deduplication

When the server echoes a user message via `message_end`, `RemoteAgent` checks if an optimistic message with matching text already exists. If so, it replaces the optimistic message in-place (preserving position) rather than appending a duplicate.

### Live event tracking

Live user messages are tracked through the unified message reducer (`src/app/message-reducer.ts`). The legacy `_liveEventMessages` bucket has been removed: `live-event` actions stamp the server `seq` as `_order`, and the `snapshot` action is authoritative for any id it contains. Surviving optimistic and live-only rows that the snapshot doesn't supersede are merged in by id and kept in their original order via `(_order, _insertionTick)` sorting. See [internals.md — Reducer ordering invariant](internals.md#reducer-ordering-invariant).

### Queue display

The client receives `queue_update` events and stores them in `_serverQueue`. The UI renders each queued message as a "pill" above the textarea:

- **Non-steered pills** show four controls: drag handle (for reordering), edit button (pencil — removes pill and populates textarea for editing), steer button, and remove button (X).
- **Steered pills** show a "Sent" badge and no interactive controls — the message is committed for delivery on abort.
- **Edit flow**: Clicking the pencil icon fires `onEditQueued`, which removes the pill from the queue and places its text back in the textarea. On re-send, the message is added to the end of the queue (or dispatched directly if the agent is idle).
- **Drag reorder**: Dragging a pill's handle fires `onReorder`, which sends a `reorder_queue` WS message. The server reorders and broadcasts the updated queue to all clients.

### Draft persistence

The message editor saves drafts to the server so unsent text survives page reloads and session switches. Drafts are saved via debounced `_flushDraft()` calls on input events, and loaded via `loadDraftFromServer()` when switching to a session.

**Race protection on session switch**: `_flushDraft()` returns a promise and stores it in `_pendingSave`. When switching sessions, `_setupPromptDraftHandlers()` awaits `_pendingSave` before loading the new session's draft. This prevents a stale save from the old session from clobbering the newly loaded draft. The teardown path (`_teardownDraftHandlers`) does not abort in-flight saves — it lets them complete so no data is lost.

**Restore resilience against Lit re-renders**: After loading a draft from the server, the value is set on the editor element. However, Lit component re-renders (triggered by connection status changes, message loading, etc.) can reset the editor's value. To handle this, draft restore uses a `requestAnimationFrame` retry loop that re-applies the draft value for up to 5 frames, ensuring the draft survives any re-renders that occur during the initial render cycle.

## Error handling

### Turn errors suppress queue draining

If a turn ends with `stopReason: "error"` (tracked via `lastTurnErrored`), `drainQueue()` is skipped on `agent_end`. Queued messages wait for the user to retry rather than being fed into a broken agent.

**Error-state queue gating (implicit unstick)**: When a turn ends with `stopReason: "error"`, `session.lastTurnErrored = true` and `session.consecutiveErrorTurns` is incremented. An incoming prompt or steer then takes one of two paths:

- **Below the cap** (`consecutiveErrorTurns < MAX_CONSECUTIVE_ERROR_TURNS`, currently `3`): `enqueuePrompt()` / `deliverLiveSteer()` implicitly unstick the session. They clear `lastTurnErrored` / `lastTurnErrorMessage` / `turnHadToolCalls`, cancel any `pendingAutoRetryTimer`, reset `transientRetryAttempts`, prepend a short `[SYSTEM: previous turn failed with: …. Your previous turn was interrupted. Pick up where you left off — re-check state first and avoid redoing completed work.]` prefix to the new text, and dispatch it. The previous failed turn is **not** retried — the incoming message is treated as fresh intent. Any messages parked in the queue while the session was wedged then drain normally (without the prefix, since the error is already cleared).
- **At or above the cap** (`consecutiveErrorTurns ≥ 3`): the incoming message is parked in `promptQueue` (the pre-change behaviour) and a warning is logged. This is the brake for persistently broken upstreams (quota exhausted, auth revoked, content filter) so we don't re-trigger the failing model on every nudge. Parked messages drain once a human clicks Retry and the underlying issue is fixed.

The counter resets to `0` on any successful `message_end` (non-error, non-aborted) and on a successful explicit `retryLastPrompt`. Steers must still route through `deliverLiveSteer()` so they persist to `promptQueue` first (`persisted: true`), preserving the Stop/retry invariant (PI-25b/PI-25c).

**Explicit UI Retry bypasses the cap.** `retryLastPrompt()` always runs regardless of `consecutiveErrorTurns` — the cap only gates the implicit path.

**TeamManager no longer second-guesses.** The previous suppression that dropped team-lead nudges when `teamLeadSession.lastTurnErrored` was true has been removed. SessionManager is the single source of truth: the nudge either unsticks the lead (≤ cap) or parks (≥ cap). If the lead is persistently broken, parked nudges drain automatically once a human fixes the upstream issue — strictly better than the old "drop on the floor" behaviour.

See also [docs/debugging.md — Session wedged after errored turn](debugging.md#session-wedged-after-errored-turn) and the AGENTS.md debug-keyword entry of the same name.

### Retry

`retryLastPrompt()` handles two cases:
- **Fresh error** (no tool calls executed): Re-sends `lastPromptText` via `rpcClient.prompt()`.
- **Mid-work error** (tool calls already ran): Sends a system continuation message so the agent picks up where it left off rather than re-executing tools.

On successful retry (turn completes without error), `lastTurnErrored` is cleared and `drainQueue()` resumes normal operation.

### Dispatch failure

If `rpcClient.prompt()` fails during direct dispatch or `drainQueue()`, Bobbit treats the text as not accepted by the agent. The rows that were already removed from `PromptQueue` are re-enqueued at the front in their original order, the optimistic `"streaming"` status is reverted to `"idle"`, and a follow-up drain is scheduled on the next tick.

The exception is a child-exit path where the session is already `terminated` or `aborting`. Bobbit does not re-enqueue into a dead bridge; sandbox recovery, force-abort recovery, or explicit Retry owns the next process.

## Abort and force-kill recovery

When the user clicks Stop (or presses Escape), the server attempts a graceful abort via `rpcClient.abort()`. If the agent doesn't become idle within 3 seconds (e.g. it's blocked in a synchronous tool like `bash sleep 60`), the process is force-killed and a fresh agent is spawned.

**Aborting status**: On abort, the server immediately broadcasts `session_status: "aborting"` so the UI can show feedback (an "Aborting..." spinner in `AgentInterface`). This covers the up-to-3-second window where the graceful abort is pending and the user would otherwise see no response. The status transitions: `streaming` → `aborting` → `idle` (graceful) or `streaming` → `aborting` → force-kill → respawn → `idle`.

**Force-kill recovery flow** (exactly-once at the transcript level):

1. User clicks Stop. `SessionManager.forceAbort()` calls `_reconcileAfterAbort(session)` *before* tearing down the bridge — the shadow ledger (`session.inFlightSteerTexts`) holds every steer text whose `rpcClient.steer()` resolved but whose `message_end(role:user)` echo has not yet arrived.
2. `_reconcileAfterAbort()` re-enqueues each ledger entry at the front of `promptQueue` with `isSteered: true` (via `enqueueAtFront()`), then clears the ledger.
3. The agent process is killed, synthetic `agent_end` emitted, fresh subprocess spawned.
4. `drainQueue()` runs. The re-enqueued steered rows are popped via `dequeueAllSteered()`, joined into a single prompt, and dispatched once.

The same reconciliation runs on the graceful path: when `handleAgentLifecycle` sees `agent_end` while `wasAborting`, it calls `_reconcileAfterAbort()` before transitioning to `idle`. Either way the result is the same — every steer the user typed appears as exactly one `<user-message>` in the rendered chat, even if the abort race tore down the agent between dispatch and echo.

### The shadow ledger

`SessionInfo.inFlightSteerTexts: string[]` is a per-session array of steer texts whose lifecycle is bounded between **dispatch** (after `await rpcClient.steer(text)` resolves in `_dispatchSteer`) and **echo** (`message_end` whose user-role body matches an entry, mirroring the SDK's `_steeringMessages` text-match splice).

- **Push**: at the bottom of `_dispatchSteer()` once the SDK has definitively accepted the batch text.
- **Splice**: in `_consumeSteerEcho()`, called from `handleAgentLifecycle` for every event. Silent no-op for non-matching messages (regular prompts, follow-ups, skill-expansion echoes whose body has been rewritten).
- **Drain**: in `_reconcileAfterAbort()`, on `agent_end` while `wasAborting` and inside `forceAbort()` immediately after `rpcClient.stop()` (i.e. after the kill, before the post-respawn `drainQueue`). The ledger is Bobbit-owned in-process state, so its content survives bridge teardown — the timing relative to the kill doesn't affect correctness.

The ledger exists because pi-coding-agent's RPC bridge surface does not expose `agentSession.clearQueue()` — the natural primitive for "pull undelivered steers back". Mirroring the SDK's text-match removal logic at our layer (mitigation B in the design doc) gives Bobbit a single, bounded reconciliation point without an upstream PR. Bounded growth is enforced by construction: every push has a paired echo or abort-drain; neither path is silently dropped.

Residual at-least-once risk: a hard process kill in the small window between `rpcClient.steer()` resolving and the SDK pushing the text onto its mirror. The window is orders of magnitude smaller than the previous always-on at-least-once contract — see [docs/design/steer-subsystem-rewrite.md §6](design/steer-subsystem-rewrite.md) for the analysis.

**Why steered messages aren't dispatched eagerly from `steer_queued`**: `steerQueued` only flips `isSteered=true` and broadcasts the queue. The next `tool_execution_end` (or, as a safety net, `agent_end` non-aborting) hands the row to the single `_dispatchSteer` site. This collapses three previous `bg.abortAllWaits` call sites into one call site inside `_dispatchSteer` (plus one inside `steerQueued` so a parked `bash_bg wait` unblocks before the tool boundary can fire). If the agent is force-killed before the boundary arrives, the row is still in `promptQueue` — never dispatched, never lost.
