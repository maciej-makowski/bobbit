# Embedded HTML preview — architecture

The preview side-panel renders agent-authored HTML alongside the chat. This
document covers the v3 architecture introduced by the embedded-html-preview
rewrite — a per-session content mount served from a cookie-authed origin path,
with SSE-driven hot reload. The browser renders that mount inside the dynamic
per-session side-panel workspace shared by regular and assistant sessions.

## Mental model

Four pieces, one mount, one URL shape:

1. **Per-session mount on disk** — `<bobbitStateDir>/preview/<sid>/` holds the
   entry HTML and any sibling assets (images, CSS, video, …). Single source of
   truth for what the panel shows.
2. **Content origin** — the gateway serves the mount at `/preview/<sid>/<path>`.
   Same shape for the iframe `src`, the "Open in new tab" button, and any link
   the user clicks inside the preview.
3. **Cookie auth** — `bobbit_session` HttpOnly cookie issued on first
   authenticated request. iframe loads, link navigation, and new-tab opens all
   carry the cookie automatically; no token-in-URL hacks.
4. **SSE hot reload** — `GET /api/sessions/:sid/preview-events` streams a
   `preview-changed` event whenever the gateway repopulates the mount. The panel
   bumps `#mtime=<n>` on the iframe `src` to force a reload.

Every populated mount also has a `contentHash`: a lowercase SHA-256 identity for
that mounted preview tree. The hash represents rendered content identity, not a
workspace-tab id or a host filesystem path. `POST /api/preview/mount`,
`GET /api/preview/mount`, and both bootstrap and live `preview-changed` SSE
events carry it so the UI can collapse duplicate preview artifacts that have the
same bytes.

Old paths and concepts that are gone:

- `<stateDir>/preview-<sid>.html` (single inline file)
- `<stateDir>/preview-<sid>.meta.json` (file-mode sidecar)
- `BOBBIT_HOST_CWD` translation in the `preview_open` extension
- `/api/preview/render` and `/api/preview/asset` routes

## Side-panel workspace integration

The UI treats the side pane as a server-backed Chrome-style tab strip beside the
chat (never above it). The shared strip can hold HTML preview, proposal, review,
pack/PR-walkthrough, artifact-viewer, and inbox tabs at the same time. Chat is
**not** a tab — there is no `chat` side-pane id, no Chat pill in the strip, and
the side pane hides entirely when a non-staff session has no side-pane tabs.

The side-panel workspace is authoritative for whether a preview tab is open. A
preview mount, immutable artifact, bootstrap response, or SSE event may update
content caches, but it must not resurrect a closed tab. Explicit preview tool
mount/open events and historical preview-card Open buttons create or focus tabs;
bootstrap and SSE updates patch only already-open tabs when they are not an
explicit open. Full workspace rules live in
[`side-panel-workspace.md`](./side-panel-workspace.md).

Preview tab identity:

- The **current** preview tab for a filename is
  `preview:entry:<encoded-filename>`. Label is unversioned (e.g.
  `report.html`). Every `preview_open` for that filename updates this
  tab in place — no duplicate, no reorder. SSE `preview-changed` updates
  it the same way.
- **Historical** preview tabs are `preview:entry:<encoded-filename>:v:<N>`.
  Label is `report.html (vN)`. One per distinct past content version of
  that filename. Versions are per-filename and assigned in chronological
  content order (see
  [`PreviewVersionRecord`](./design/side-panel-tab-contract.md#42-version-assignment)).
- The live mount carries `contentHash`. When a v3 historical card's hash
  matches the current filename tab's hash, the workspace **collapses**
  to the current tab — no duplicate, no unnecessary remount. When hashes
  differ, the historical `:v:N` tab opens beside the current tab.
- Legacy v1/v2 markers (archived sessions) stay historical even when
  their remount response includes `contentHash`. Only v3 markers opt
  into same-content collapse.
- Desktop renders the strip horizontally; mobile renders the same tab
  set in the slide-pane header. There is no desktop-only preview
  capability.

Reopen failures stay local to the tab/card: missing file snapshots
disable with "File no longer available", parse or fetch errors leave the
button retryable and log `[PreviewRenderer] reopen failed`, and
background tab-remount failures log `[panel-workspace] preview tab
restore failed` without changing preview serving semantics.

### Immutable preview artifacts

A live preview mount (`<stateDir>/preview/<sid>/`) is mutable: every
`preview_open` overwrites it, and `preview_open(file=…)` mutates a file
on the host that the user may then edit out from under us. To make
"reopen this old `preview_open` card and see what was mounted *then*"
work, every successful mount is also captured into an immutable
artifact store at `<stateDir>/preview-artifacts/<sid>/<artifactId>/`.
Source of truth: `src/server/preview/artifacts.ts`.

What the store records:

```
<stateDir>/preview-artifacts/<sid>/<artifactId>/
    artifact.json       ← { artifactId, sessionId, entry, contentHash, files[], mtime, createdAt }
    mount/              ← byte-identical copy of the live mount tree
        report.html
        styles.css
        img/chart.png
```

- `artifactId` is 6 URL-safe random bytes (8 chars) — small enough to
  fit inside the 250-byte v3 marker cap while preserving 48 bits of
  entropy.
- `persistPreviewArtifact` re-hashes the staged copy and verifies the
  entry is present before committing the rename. A captured artifact is
  byte-identical to what was mounted at that moment.
- `findPreviewArtifactByHash(sessionId, contentHash)` deduplicates: a
  repeated mount of identical content reuses the existing artifact id.
- `removeArtifacts(sessionId)` runs when a session is purged.
  `sweepOrphanArtifacts(knownSessionIds)` is the explicit maintenance
  helper for removing artifact dirs whose session is gone.

New endpoint:

| Route | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `POST /api/preview/artifacts/<artifactId>/restore?sessionId=<sid>` | `restorePreviewArtifact` rehydrates the named artifact into the single live mount and fires `broadcastPreviewChanged` so SSE subscribers see the restored content. Validation and staging happen before the live mount is touched, so missing / wrong-session / corrupt artifacts cannot alias to current content. Body may include `{ artifactId }` for symmetry but must match the route. |
| `GET /preview/<sid>/_artifact/<artifactId>/<rel-path>` | Direct read from the per-artifact mount directory. Bypasses the single live mount slot, so switching between artifact-backed preview tabs is a pure iframe `src` change — no POST round-trip, no iframe blanking, no mount swap. Same `<base>` + theme-snapshot + bridge-script rewrites as `/preview/<sid>/...` (the base href is the artifact-prefixed path). Authoritative dir: `artifactMountDir(sid, artifactId)`. |

Mount-endpoint extensions:

- `POST /api/preview/mount` with `{ artifactId }` is an alternative
  restore entry point that cannot be combined with `html` / `file` /
  `assets` / `manifest`.
- `POST /api/preview/mount` with `html` / `file` returns
  `artifactId` alongside the existing response fields. The mount is
  captured into the store atomically with the broadcast.
- `GET /api/preview/mount` looks up the artifact whose `contentHash`
  matches the current mounted content and includes that `artifactId`.
- SSE `preview-changed` events (bootstrap and live) include `artifactId`
  whenever a known artifact matches the broadcast `contentHash`.

The live mount stays single — the artifact store is an additional
immutable restore source, not a second live mount.

For artifact-backed preview tabs, the client now uses the per-artifact
URL (`/preview/<sid>/_artifact/<artifactId>/<entry>`) directly instead of
restoring into the live mount. This is what powers instant switching
between multiple preview tabs without re-mounting on every click. The
active tab's `artifactId` is read off the panel-tab itself, not mirrored
into global state, so SSE / bootstrap updates of `state.previewPanelEntry`
can never desync the iframe `src` from the visible tab. The live mount
slot remains the source for tabs without an `artifactId` (assistant /
live preview).

### Reopen-tab decision flow

When the user clicks **Open** on a historical `preview_open` tool card
(`src/ui/tools/renderers/PreviewRenderer.ts`):

| Marker shape | Restore source | Tab behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| v3 with `artifactId` | `POST /api/preview/artifacts/<id>/restore` | Always restorable. If `contentHash` matches the current filename tab, collapse to it; otherwise open / select `preview:entry:<file>:v:N`. |
| v3 without `artifactId`, with `html` / `file` original params | `POST /api/preview/mount {html\|file}` | Remount the original; the POST response's `artifactId` and `contentHash` are attached to the tab. Same collapse rule. |
| v3 without `artifactId` and no remount body | None (recorded entry / mtime / url) | Select the recorded entry; iframe points at the existing mount path. Best-effort. |
| Legacy v1 / v2 | `POST /api/preview/mount {html\|file}` | Stays historical even when the response includes `contentHash`. |

## Per-session mount

Single source of truth: `src/server/preview/mount.ts`.

Layout:

```
<bobbitStateDir>/preview/<sid>/
    index.html              ← entry (or whatever the agent named)
    inline.html             ← when html=... is used
    videos/foo.webm
    thumbs/0001.jpg
    styles.css
```

| Constraint | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Inline default entry | `inline.html` | `DEFAULT_INLINE_ENTRY` |
| Entry filename | single segment, no `/` `\` `..` `\0` | `validateEntry` |

Asset inclusion is **explicit opt-in**: `mountFile` copies only the named
entry plus caller-declared `assets[]` (literals or single-segment globs).
There is no BFS-of-the-parent-directory fallback and no size cap — the
agent is responsible for declaring only what it needs. Undeclared siblings
are never copied into the mount and never reach the content origin. See
[Mount endpoints — Explicit asset opt-in](#explicit-asset-opt-in-file-form)
for the full contract, validation rules, and rationale.

**Lifecycle.** Mount is created lazily on the first `preview_open` for a
session. `removeMount(sid)` is wired into the session-archive / cleanup path
and is idempotent on bad input.

**Atomic writes.** `writeInline` writes to a sibling tmp file in the mount and
`fs.renameSync`s into place — readers never see a half-written entry. Failures
unlink the tmp file before propagating.

**`mountFile` semantics.** Wipes the mount, copies the entry file, then
copies each declared asset — literals (`styles.css`, `sub/file.png`) or
single-segment globs (`img/*.png`, `chart.?.svg`). `**`, `[...]`, and
`{a,b}` are rejected. Each resolved asset's realpath must stay within the
entry's source directory; symlink escapes throw `PreviewMountError(403)`.
Literal assets that don't exist throw `404`; globs with no matches are not
an error. Hardlinks where supported, falls back to `copyFile`.

**Errors.** All failures throw `PreviewMountError` with `statusCode` (`400` /
`403` / `404` / `500`); the route handler maps directly to HTTP.

## Content origin: `/preview/<sid>/<rel-path>`

Single source of truth: `src/server/preview/content-route.ts`.

Routing inside the gateway happens before API auth so the iframe — which
cannot send `Authorization` — can authenticate via the session cookie.

Behaviour by path shape:

| Request | Response |
|---|---|
| `GET /preview/<sid>` | `301` redirect to `/preview/<sid>/` (so relative URLs resolve) |
| `GET /preview/<sid>/` | `302` to the picked entry — `index.html` → `inline.html` → first `*.html` alphabetically (`pickEntry`); `404` if mount is missing/empty |
| `GET /preview/<sid>/<file.html>` | `200 text/html`, body rewritten — `<base href="/preview/<sid>/">` injected and the shared theme/swipe bridge scripts appended |
| `GET /preview/<sid>/<asset>` | `200 <mime>` streamed as-is (no body rewrite) |
| `GET /preview/<sid>/../etc/passwd` | `403` — path-traversal rejected |
| `GET /preview/<sid>/missing` | `404` |
| Method other than `GET`/`HEAD` | `405` |

**Theme bridge.** `injectBaseAndScripts(body, baseTag, PREVIEW_BRIDGE_SCRIPTS)`
adds the `<base href>` and the bridge scripts only when the response is
`text/html`. Static assets pass through untouched.

**MIME lookup.** `src/server/preview/mime.ts`. Minimal table covering the
HTML-report long tail (HTML, CSS, JS, images, fonts, video, JSON, etc.); the
fallback is `application/octet-stream`.

**Path-traversal guard.** `src/server/preview/path-guard.ts::resolveAssetPath`
rejects backslashes, NULs, absolute paths, and any descendant whose realpath
escapes the per-session mount. `400` from the guard becomes `403` to the
caller (traversal); `404` becomes `404`. There is no size guard at read
time — asset size is the agent's responsibility (see "Explicit asset
opt-in" above).

**Cache headers.** All responses set `Cache-Control: no-store` plus
`X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`. Browser caching never gets between the
agent and the user.

**Auth fallback for testing.** The route accepts an admin bearer token via
`Authorization: Bearer …` or `?token=…`. Iframe loads always go through the
cookie path; the bearer fallback is for `curl` and SSE callers.

## Cookie auth

Single source of truth: `src/server/auth/cookie.ts`.

```
Set-Cookie: bobbit_session=<32-byte hex>; HttpOnly; SameSite=Lax; Path=/; Max-Age=2592000
```

`Secure` is added outside localhost mode (the browser would discard a
`Secure` cookie on plain HTTP).

- **Storage:** `<stateDir>/auth-cookies.json` (`mode 0o600`, debounced
  flushes). Survives gateway restart.
- **Value:** opaque 32-byte hex, minted server-side. The bearer token is
  never embedded — the cookie can be revoked independently.
- **Issued:** by the API request guard the first time a Bearer-authenticated
  request lands without a valid cookie (`issueIfMissing`).
- **Verified:** `tryAuth(req, store)` reads the `bobbit_session` cookie and
  checks it against the store.
- **Localhost short-circuit:** the content route honours `isLocalhost: true`
  and skips the cookie check, matching legacy behaviour.
- **Sandbox tokens** keep their existing scoped allow-list and do **not**
  mint cookies. The content route refuses sandbox-scoped requests.

The Bearer-token-in-URL flow stays as a one-shot bootstrap (mobile links,
OAuth callback). It does not authenticate per-request UI traffic any more.

## SSE — `GET /api/sessions/:sid/preview-events`

Single source of truth: route block in `src/server/server.ts`, channel in
`src/server/preview/events.ts`, client in `src/app/preview-panel.ts`.

- `200 text/event-stream` with `Cache-Control: no-cache`, `Connection: keep-alive`,
  `X-Accel-Buffering: no`.
- Initial frame: `event: hello\ndata: {ts}`.
- Live frame: `event: preview-changed\ndata: {entry, mtime, url, path, contentHash}` —
  emitted by `broadcastPreviewChanged()` after every successful
  `POST /api/preview/mount`. The full payload is forwarded verbatim so the
  client can seed `entry`, `mtime`, and content identity without a follow-up
  fetch. SSE does not include `relPath`; only the mount REST responses do.
- **Bootstrap on connect:** if a mount already exists for the session, the
  handler emits one `preview-changed` event synchronously after subscribing.
  This closes the race where a `broadcastPreviewChanged()` fires between
  EventSource open and listener registration. The bootstrap shape is
  identical to a live event, including `contentHash`, so the client doesn't
  distinguish bootstrap from live events.
- 25 s `:keepalive` comments to defeat idle proxies.
- Cookie auth (or admin bearer); sandbox-token requests get `403`.

The client subscribes via the standard EventSource, records
`state.previewPanelContentHash`, and bumps `state.previewPanelMtime` on each
`preview-changed` to force iframe reload. Preview-tab selection uses the hash to
collapse matching live/historical artifacts.

## Mount endpoints

### `POST /api/preview/mount?sessionId=<sid>`

Accepts one of:

- `{ "html": "<…>", "entry"?: "report.html" }` — write inline. `entry` must
  be a single path segment. `assets`/`manifest` are not valid here and
  produce a `400`.
- `{ "file": "/abs/path/report.html", "assets"?: ["styles.css", "img/*.png"], "manifest"?: "preview-manifest.json" }`
  — copy entry plus declared assets (see below). `file` must be absolute
  and end in `.html` / `.htm`.

#### Explicit asset opt-in (`file` form)

Asset inclusion is **agent-driven** — the gateway never walks the parent
directory. `mountFile` copies *only* the named entry HTML, plus whatever
the caller explicitly declares via `assets[]` and/or a `manifest` file.
Undeclared siblings stay on the host filesystem and never enter the
per-session mount.

**Why explicit opt-in.** The original implementation BFS-walked the
parent directory of the entry file (capped at 25 MiB). This had two
problems:

- **Privacy / accidental exposure.** Anything sitting next to the entry
  HTML — drafts, `.env` files, uncommitted notes, other agents' work in
  progress — was copied into the mount and served over HTTP. The
  ergonomic default leaked sibling content.
- **Footgun on real worktrees.** Pointing `file` at an HTML report
  inside a project worktree typically tripped the 25 MiB cap and
  failed with `413`, forcing agents into ad-hoc workarounds like
  `cp report.html /tmp/x/`.

Making declaration explicit fixes both. The agent only copies what it
needs; the cap is no longer load-bearing and has been removed.

**Inline `assets[]`.** Each entry is a path relative to the entry
file's directory. Both literals and **single-segment** globs are
supported:

```json
{
  "file": "/.../report.html",
  "assets": ["styles.css", "logo.svg", "img/*.png", "chart.?.svg"]
}
```

**Manifest file.** `manifest` is a path (relative to the entry's
directory) pointing at a sibling JSON file of the form:

```json
{ "assets": ["styles.css", "img/*.png"] }
```

The manifest's array is concatenated with inline `assets[]` (de-duplicated
in order). Use whichever fits — they compose.

**Validation rules** (apply to both `assets[]` entries and the manifest's
resolved array, enforced in `mount.ts` and the path-guard):

| Rejected | Why |
|---|---|
| Absolute paths (`/etc/passwd`, `C:/...`) | Must be relative to the entry's directory |
| `..` segments | No escapes out of the entry directory |
| Backslash `\` | Forward-slash only; cross-platform consistency |
| NUL (`\0`) | Defence in depth against path smuggling |
| `**` recursive globs | Encourages over-broad inclusion |
| Character classes `[abc]` | Not implemented |
| Brace expansion `{a,b}` | Not implemented |
| Symlinks whose realpath escapes the entry directory | Realpath-based check, returns `403` |

Single-segment `*` and `?` globs match within one path segment only —
`img/*.png` matches `img/foo.png` but not `img/sub/foo.png`.

**Error matrix:**

| Status | When |
|---|---|
| `400` | invalid sessionId, missing body, bad entry, non-absolute `file` path, `file` not `.html`/`.htm`, `html` not a string, `assets`/`manifest` passed alongside `html`, non-string `assets[]` entry, invalid asset path (absolute / `..` / `\` / `\0` / `**` / `[...]` / `{a,b}`), manifest JSON parse error, manifest missing `assets[]` array |
| `403` | sandbox out of scope; symlink whose realpath escapes the entry's source directory |
| `404` | source `file` missing or not a regular file; `manifest` file missing; **literal** asset missing (a glob with zero matches is *not* an error) |
| `500` | unexpected copy failure |

**Response shape.** Returns `200` with:

```json
{
  "url": "/preview/3f2c…/report.html",
  "path": "C:/Users/.../bobbit/state/preview/3f2c…/report.html",
  "relPath": "3f2c…/report.html",
  "entry": "report.html",
  "mtime": 1775853741666,
  "contentHash": "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef",
  "assets": ["img/chart.png", "styles.css"]
}
```

The `relPath` field is the host-invariant `<sessionId>/<entry>` identifier used
by new v3 snapshot blocks. `contentHash` is the mounted preview-tree SHA-256
identity used by the workspace for same-content collapse. The `assets[]` field
is echoed back only on the `file` form, sorted, and contains the resolved
relative paths actually copied (after glob expansion and de-duplication). The
inline `html` form omits it. Renderer reopen flows can round-trip this list back
into a follow-up `POST /api/preview/mount` to re-stamp the same mount.

After every success the server calls `broadcastPreviewChanged(sessionId, …)`
with `{entry, mtime, url, path, contentHash}` to fan out a `preview-changed` SSE
event to every subscribed tab.

### `GET /api/preview/mount?sessionId=<sid>`

Bootstrap probe used by the panel after session-select. Returns the same
`{ url, path, relPath, entry, mtime, contentHash }` shape as the `POST`, or
`404 { error: "no preview mount" }` when the mount is missing or empty. Resolves
the entry via the same `pickEntry()` helper the content route uses.

## Snapshot v3 marker

Single source of truth: `defaults/tools/html/snapshot.ts`.

The `preview_open` tool stamps the result with a constant-size marker block.
The marker identifies the preview artifact for reopenable tool-card tabs; it
does not create a second server mount.

```
__preview_snapshot_v3__
{"kind":"preview","url":"/preview/<sid>/<entry>","path":"<sid>/<entry>","entry":"<entry>","contentHash":"<sha256>","artifactId":"<id>"}
```

≤ 250 bytes per block, regardless of HTML size. All of `entry`,
`contentHash`, and `artifactId` are **optional** — the builder
(`buildPreviewSnapshotV3Block`) tries progressively more compact
payloads (long URL with full path, short URL with `entry` filename as
`path`, alias keys like `aid` for `artifactId`) and emits whichever
complete variant still fits the 250-byte cap. If even the compact form
blows the cap, the builder falls back to the bare
`{kind, url, path}` payload without identity fields. The cap is fixed
by `tests/e2e/preview-token-cost.spec.ts` and must not be raised to
make room for larger payloads.

`artifactId` is what makes historical reopen byte-accurate after the
user has overwritten the original source file: the renderer prefers
`POST /api/preview/artifacts/<artifactId>/restore` over re-reading
`html` / `file` params. See ["Immutable preview artifacts"](#immutable-preview-artifacts)
for the store layout and validation contract.

The renderer parses the marker via `parseSnapshot()` and uses `url` /
`path`, optional `entry`, optional `contentHash`, optional `artifactId`,
and the original tool params to drive the **Open** button on tool
cards. Opening a card selects a source-derived preview tab immediately,
keyed by filename via `previewEntryTabId(entry)` / `previewVersionedTabId(entry, N)`.
The restore source preference is `artifactId` → original `html` / `file`
params → recorded entry/mtime (best-effort). When the marker omitted
`contentHash` to preserve the 250-byte cap, a successful remount `POST`
returns the hash; the renderer attaches it to the tab so same-content
collapse can still fire.

**`path` is host-invariant.** The field carries the project-root-relative
`<sessionId>/<entry>` identifier (forward slashes on every OS), not the
host-absolute path on disk. The single source of truth is
`MountResult.relPath` in `src/server/preview/mount.ts`; the agent tool in
`defaults/tools/html/extension.ts` prefers `relPath` over the legacy
host-absolute `path` when calling `buildPreviewSnapshotV3Block`. Bounding the
payload by content shape (rather than by where `bobbitStateDir()` happens to
live on disk) is what keeps the 250 B per-block cap holding on macOS
(`/private/var/folders/...`) and Windows E2E harness paths, even when the
optional `contentHash` fits. Archived sessions that recorded the legacy
host-absolute form still parse — `parseSnapshot` only requires a non-empty
string — but new blocks always use the relative form. Per-block size is pinned by
`tests/e2e/preview-token-cost.spec.ts`.

**Legacy markers** are preserved in the parser **only** for archived
sessions:

| Marker | Payload | Renderer behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| `__preview_snapshot_v1__` | raw inline HTML | Create/select a historical preview tab and remount via `POST /api/preview/mount {html}`; the tab stays historical (does not collapse into the current filename tab) even when the remount response includes `contentHash` or `artifactId` |
| `__preview_snapshot_v2__` | `{kind:"file",path}` | Create/select a historical preview tab and remount via `POST /api/preview/mount {file}`; same historical-only rule as v1 |
| `__preview_snapshot_v3__` | `{kind:"preview",url,path,entry?,contentHash?,artifactId?}` | Create/select a tab keyed by filename. Prefer `POST /api/preview/artifacts/<artifactId>/restore` when present, else remount from original `html`/`file` params, else select by recorded entry/mtime. Collapse to the current filename tab when `contentHash` already matches; otherwise open / select `preview:entry:<file>:v:N`. |

The v1/v2 builder functions have been deleted — no new code path emits them.
The marker constants are tagged `Read-only legacy support … Do not extend`
in both `snapshot.ts` and `PreviewRenderer.ts`. Reopen flows for v1/v2 in
`PreviewRenderer.ts::onClick` route through the unified mount endpoint, so
WP-G's deletion of `/api/preview/render` and `/api/preview/asset` doesn't
break old archived sessions. Those legacy flows preserve historical-tab
semantics even though the unified mount endpoint now returns `contentHash`.
Only v3 markers opt into live-tab collapse by content identity.

## Theme-token snapshot for standalone tabs

Single source of truth: `src/server/preview/theme-snapshot.ts`.

Every preview HTML response carries an inline `<style>` block of the host
app's theme tokens, injected into `<head>` alongside the `<base>` tag by
`injectBaseAndScripts()` in `content-route.ts` (the pure-string contract is
preserved — no HTML parser).

**Why.** The runtime theme bridge in `src/shared/preview-bridge-scripts.ts`
(`PREVIEW_THEME_BRIDGE`) reads CSS custom properties from
`parent.document.documentElement`. Inside the embedded panel iframe that
works; in a standalone tab opened via "Open in new tab", `parent === window`
and the preview document has no theme vars of its own, so every
`var(--background)` / `var(--chart-N)` resolved to empty and the page
rendered unstyled.

**How.** At server startup `theme-snapshot.ts` parses the `:root` and `.dark`
blocks of `src/ui/app.css` once, extracts every `--*` declaration, and caches
a ready-to-emit `<style data-bobbit-preview-theme="snapshot">…</style>`
string. `content-route.ts` injects this snapshot for every served HTML
response — the `data-bobbit-preview-theme="snapshot"` marker is the debugging
handle (open devtools → Elements → search the `<head>`).

**Two semantics, one mechanism:**

| Surface | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Standalone tab (`parent === window`) | `PREVIEW_THEME_BRIDGE` early-returns. The inline snapshot governs — colours and fonts are fixed at the moment the request was served. Live host-app theme toggles do **not** propagate. This is an explicit, accepted trade: standalone tabs are snapshots. |
| Embedded panel iframe (`parent !== window`) | Snapshot supplies defaults; the bridge runs and live-mirrors the host-app's `documentElement` custom properties on every theme toggle. |

No per-request CSS parsing in the hot path — the snapshot string is built
once and reused for every response.

## Atomic-swap mount lifecycle

Single source of truth: `mountFile()` in `src/server/preview/mount.ts`.

**Why.** The previous flow was wipe-then-copy: `wipeContents(destRoot)` ran
before the entry copy. Any source path whose realpath resolved inside
`destRoot` (e.g. an agent re-opening a file the previous `preview_open`
call had materialised into the mount) was deleted before being read —
`fs.copyFileSync` then ENOENT'd, or the OS short-circuited same-inode
operations and threw "cannot copy a file onto itself". Wipe-then-copy also
left a half-empty mount visible to any `/preview/<sid>/<entry>` GET that
hit during the window between wipe and final copy.

**How.** Stage everything into a sibling tmp directory under
`previewRoot()` first, then atomically swap:

1. Create `<previewRoot>/.<sid>.tmp-<pid>-<ms>-<rand6>/`.
2. Resolve and copy the entry plus all declared `assets[]` (literals and
   single-segment globs) into the tmp dir. **All source data is read
   before `destRoot` is touched** — the same-mount-source race is gone.
3. On staging error: `rmSync(tmp, { recursive: true, force: true })` and
   leave `destRoot` untouched.
4. On success: `wipeContents(destRoot)` (see inode note below) followed
   by per-entry `renameSync` from tmp into `destRoot`. The tmp dir is
   removed once empty.

**Inode preservation.** The wipe step deliberately uses `wipeContents`
(remove the contents of `destRoot`) rather than `rmSync(destRoot)`
(remove the directory itself). The directory's inode survives, so the
long-lived `fs.watch` handle held by `watchMount()` keeps firing for SSE
consumers across mount swaps.

**`writeInline()` is unaffected.** It already writes the single entry to
a sibling tmp file and `renameSync`s into place — atomic by construction.

**SSE.** `broadcastPreviewChanged()` still fires on every successful
mount, including identical re-opens, so the iframe reload path (`?mtime=`
cache-buster) sees every call.

## Sandbox integration

Single source of truth: `src/server/agent/docker-args.ts`.

Per-container bind mounts:

| Container shape | Host path | Container path |
|---|---|---|
| Per-session container (`sessionId`, no `projectId`) | `<stateDir>/preview/<sid>/` | `/bobbit/preview` |
| Per-project container (`projectId` set) | `<stateDir>/preview/` | `/bobbit/preview-root` |

In the per-project case, every session sharing the long-lived container
resolves its own subtree via `BOBBIT_SESSION_ID`.

The agent does **not** translate paths. It always POSTs to
`/api/preview/mount` and the gateway resolves filesystem paths host-side.
The bind mount exists only for symmetry — so any in-container tool reading
back the preview tree sees the same bytes the gateway just wrote.

## File-by-file map

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `src/server/preview/mount.ts` | Per-session mount lifecycle, atomic writes, `mountFile` (explicit asset opt-in), `contentHash` calculation, watcher |
| `src/server/preview/content-route.ts` | `/preview/<sid>/<rel>` handler (live mount) and `/preview/<sid>/_artifact/<id>/<rel>` (per-artifact stable URL), entry pick, `<base>` + bridge injection |
| `src/server/preview/path-guard.ts` | Path-traversal defence (realpath-based) |
| `src/server/preview/mime.ts` | MIME-type lookup |
| `src/server/preview/events.ts` | Per-session `preview-changed` channel carrying mount identity payloads |
| `src/server/auth/cookie.ts` | `bobbit_session` cookie issuance + verification, on-disk store |
| `src/server/server.ts` | `POST/GET /api/preview/mount`, SSE route, broadcast on success |
| `src/server/agent/docker-args.ts` | Sandbox bind mounts (`/bobbit/preview`, `/bobbit/preview-root`) |
| `src/shared/preview-bridge-scripts.ts` | Theme/swipe bridge scripts injected into HTML responses |
| `defaults/tools/html/extension.ts` | `preview_open` tool — POSTs to `/api/preview/mount`, stamps v3 marker with optional `contentHash` |
| `defaults/tools/html/snapshot.ts` | Marker constants, `buildPreviewSnapshotV3Block`, `parseSnapshot`, 250-byte v3 cap |
| `src/server/preview/artifacts.ts` | Immutable artifact store — capture, restore, hash-based dedupe, orphan sweep |
| `src/ui/tools/renderers/PreviewRenderer.ts` | Open button on tool cards; artifact restore → source remount → recorded-entry fallback; live-hash remount skip; filename-keyed tab dispatch |
| `src/shared/side-panel-workspace.ts` | Server/client workspace model shared by preview and other panel kinds |
| `src/app/side-panel-workspace.ts` | Server hydrate/mutate controller, optimistic in-memory updates, localStorage migration, popout URL helper |
| `src/app/panel-workspace.ts` | Preview/proposal/review/pack tab id helpers and per-filename preview version ledger; file-fixture fallback only |
| `src/app/preview-panel.ts` | EventSource subscription, mount bootstrap, explicit preview tab open/update, older-version-rehydration guard |
| `src/app/render.ts` | Shared side-panel shell, tab strip, mobile slider, shared controls, active-content lookup by server workspace tab id |

## Acceptance properties

- Tool result is constant ≤250 bytes regardless of HTML size — no HTML in the
  conversation transcript. Optional v3 `entry`, `contentHash`, and
  `artifactId` fields are omitted (or compacted via the builder's progressive
  fallback) rather than raising the cap.
- Mount `POST` / `GET` responses and bootstrap/live `preview-changed` SSE events
  expose a 64-hex `contentHash` for the current mounted preview tree, plus an
  `artifactId` when a captured artifact matches the current content.
- Every successful `POST /api/preview/mount` (html or file form) atomically
  captures the mounted bytes into an immutable artifact under
  `<stateDir>/preview-artifacts/<sid>/`.
- `POST /api/preview/artifacts/<artifactId>/restore` rehydrates the named
  artifact into the single live mount, validates and stages before touching the
  live mount, and rolls back on failure.
- Iframe link clicks navigate inside the preview origin; assets resolve via
  `<base href="/preview/<sid>/">`.
- "Open in new tab" works because the cookie has `Path=/`.
- Edits to the mount fan out via SSE within ~50 ms (debounce window in
  `watchMount`).
- The side-pane tab strip never contains a Chat pill; chat is rendered outside
  the strip (see [`side-panel-workspace.md`](./side-panel-workspace.md)).
- The current preview tab for a filename is updated in place by explicit
  preview open events; bootstrap/SSE metadata updates patch only already-open
  tabs and do not resurrect closed tabs.
- Opening a historical v3 card whose `contentHash` matches the current
  filename tab collapses to that tab and skips the remount POST; otherwise it
  opens `preview:entry:<file>:v:N` keyed off the per-filename version ledger.
- Historical artifacts with different `contentHash` values remain separate
  and independently restorable through the one live server mount.
- Archived sessions with v1 / v2 markers continue to render an Open button that
  re-stamps the mount via `POST /api/preview/mount` but stays historical even
  when that response includes `contentHash` or `artifactId`.
