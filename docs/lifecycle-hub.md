## What it is, and why

The Lifecycle Hub is the server-side seam that lets **pack-contributed providers** inject
*ambient context* into an agent session at well-defined moments — when a session starts, before
each prompt, after a turn, before a compaction, and at shutdown. A provider is trusted,
pack-shipped code (see [provider contributions](marketplace.md#provider-contributions-providersidyaml)
and the [authoring guide](extension-host-authoring.md)); the Hub is what eventually *runs* that
code and folds its output into the prompt.

The design problem the Hub solves: ambient context is powerful but dangerous. Untrusted *output*
and slow/looping *code* can both wreck a session. So the Hub is built around a single principle —

> **The provider code is trusted; its output is not, and its runtime is bounded.**

Concretely that means every dispatch is:

- **Isolated** — each provider runs on the Extension Host worker tier (`ModuleHost.invoke`),
  the same confined-worker seam that backs pack routes/actions. The worker is terminated on
  settle or timeout, so a runaway provider cannot block the gateway.
- **Budgeted** — each provider has a token budget and a wall-clock timeout; a global token cap
  bounds the whole dispatch. Over-budget content is truncated/dropped, never silently inflated.
- **Fenced** — accepted content is wrapped in a `<context-block …>` envelope with provenance
  attributes, so the model can tell ambient provider text apart from the user's own words.
- **Validated + provenance-forced** — the Hub re-checks the shape of every returned block,
  forces the `providerId`, and recomputes the token estimate host-side. A provider cannot
  claim to be another provider or under-report its size.
- **Traced** — one trace row per dispatch records which providers ran, how long they took, how
  many blocks they contributed, and any error — for debugging and budget tuning.
- **Fault-isolated** — a provider that throws, times out, or returns malformed blocks becomes a
  *diagnostic* and the dispatch **continues**; one bad provider never fails the others or the
  session.

The three core modules live under `src/server/agent/`:

| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `context-blocks.ts` | The `ContextBlock` shape, token estimation, fencing, and the budget algorithm. |
| `lifecycle-hub.ts` | The `LifecycleHub` class: resolve providers, dispatch a hook, collect/validate/budget, write a trace row. |
| `context-trace-store.ts` | Append-only JSONL trace per session, size-capped. |

## Hooks

A **lifecycle hook** is a named moment in a session's life. The hook set is:

| Hook | Dispatch point | How it fires | Wiring goal | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `sessionSetup` | Once, when a session is created — seed durable context. | Server-side, in the session-setup pipeline. | G1.3 | **wired** |
| `beforePrompt` | Before each turn's prompt reaches the model. | In-process **provider-bridge** extension → `before-prompt` endpoint. | G1.4 | **wired** |
| `beforeCompact` | Before transcript compaction. | In-process **provider-bridge** extension → `before-compact` endpoint. | G1.4 | **wired** |
| `afterTurn` | After a turn completes. | Server-side, from the gateway's `agent_end` event. | G1.4 | **wired** |
| `sessionShutdown` | When a session is torn down. | Server-side, from the session archive path. | G1.4 | **wired** |

A provider declares which hooks it wants in its YAML `hooks:` list; the Hub only dispatches a
hook to providers that declared it. The hooks split by **where** they fire:

- **Server-side hooks** (`sessionSetup`, `afterTurn`, `sessionShutdown`) dispatch directly from
  the gateway with no agent round-trip — they observe lifecycle moments but cannot amend the
  outgoing turn.
- **Per-turn hooks** (`beforePrompt`, `beforeCompact`) must run *inside* the agent process so
  they can observe/amend the turn, so they fire via a Bobbit-generated
  [provider-bridge pi extension](#the-provider-bridge-extension) that calls back into the
  gateway.

The selector hooks `beforeGoalCreate` / `beforeSessionSpawn` remain a separate, later goal (G8).

## The `ContextBlock` contract

A provider hook returns blocks the Hub will consider injecting. The shape
(`context-blocks.ts`):

```ts
type ContextBlockAuthority = "memory" | "skill" | "tool" | "workflow" | "role" | "generic";

interface ContextBlock {
  id: string;            // provider-local block id (used in the fence envelope)
  title: string;         // human/source label → fence `source="…"`
  providerId: string;    // FORCED host-side to the dispatching provider's id
  authority: ContextBlockAuthority;
  content: string;       // the actual text injected into the prompt
  reason: string;        // why this block is here → fence `reason="…"`
  priority: number;      // higher = kept first under budget pressure
  tokenEstimate: number; // RECOMPUTED host-side from content
}
```

### Host-forced provenance — what a provider cannot fake

When a hook returns, the Hub validates each candidate block and **rewrites two fields**:

- **`providerId` is forced** to the id of the provider that actually ran. A block cannot
  attribute itself to another provider.
- **`tokenEstimate` is recomputed** host-side via `estimateTokens(content)` — a provider cannot
  under-report its size to dodge the budget.

`estimateTokens` is `Math.ceil(content.length / 4)`. This deliberately matches
`PromptSection.tokens` in `system-prompt.ts` so the Hub's accounting lines up with how the rest
of the prompt is measured.

### Validation — malformed blocks are dropped

A returned value is accepted as a block list if it is either an array of blocks or an object
with a `blocks` array. Each candidate must be a plain object with string `id`, `title`,
`content`, and `reason`; an `authority` in the allowed set; and a finite numeric `priority`.
Anything else is **dropped** and counted as malformed (one diagnostic per provider that
produced malformed blocks). The provider is not failed for it — valid blocks from the same
return still flow through.

## Fencing

Accepted blocks are wrapped so the model can distinguish ambient provider text from the
conversation. `fenceBlock(block)` produces:

```
<context-block id="…" source="…" authority="…" reason="…">
{content}
</context-block>
```

- `source` is the block's `title`; `id`, `authority`, and `reason` map straight across.
- **Attribute values are sanitised**: newlines are collapsed to spaces and `"` becomes
  `&quot;`, so a crafted `title`/`reason` cannot break out of the attribute or inject a fake
  tag. The `content` itself is placed between the tags verbatim (on its own lines).

## The budget algorithm

`applyBudgets(blocks, perProviderMax, globalMax)` decides which blocks survive. It returns
`{ kept, omitted }`, where each omitted entry carries a `why`. The rules, in order:

1. **Sort by `priority` descending**, ties broken by original collection order (which follows
   provider order). High-priority context wins scarce budget.
2. **Walk the sorted list, accumulating usage.** For each block the available *headroom* is the
   smaller of the remaining global budget and the remaining per-provider budget —
   `headroom = min(globalMax − globalUsed, providerMax − providerUsed)`. **The global cap binds
   before any per-provider headroom**: a provider can never spend budget the global cap has
   already exhausted, even if its own allowance remains.
3. **A block that fits is kept** and its tokens are charged to both the global and per-provider
   tallies.
4. **The first block that does *not* fit triggers single-shot truncation.** If the remaining
   headroom is at least 32 tokens, that one block's `content` is truncated to fit (with a
   trailing `…[truncated]` marker) and kept; its `tokenEstimate` is recomputed. If the headroom
   is below 32 tokens — or truncation would leave a remainder under 32 tokens — the block is
   **dropped instead of truncated** (never emit a uselessly tiny fragment).
5. **Every block after the truncation point is omitted** (`why: "after-truncation"`). The
   algorithm truncates at most one block, then stops keeping.

The `why` reasons you'll see in `omitted`: `after-truncation`, `truncated-below-min`,
`below-min`.

A `perProviderMax` entry comes from each provider's clamped `budget.maxTokens`; a provider with
no entry falls back to the global cap. `globalMax` defaults to **4000 tokens** (the Hub's
`globalMaxTokens` constructor option).

## The `LifecycleHub` class

```ts
class LifecycleHub {
  constructor(deps: {
    registry: PackContributionRegistry;
    moduleHost: ModuleHost;
    trace: ContextTraceStore;
    gatewayInfo: () => { baseUrl: string; token: string };
    globalMaxTokens?: number; // default 4000
  });

  dispatch(
    hook: LifecycleHook,
    base: Omit<HookCtx, "budget" | "config" | "gateway">,
  ): Promise<{ blocks: ContextBlock[]; diagnostics: HubDiagnostic[] }>;
}
```

### What `dispatch` does

1. **Resolve providers.** It asks `registry.listProviders(base.projectId)` (G1.1's resolver —
   installed, active, enabled providers for the project scope) and keeps only those whose
   `hooks` include the requested hook.
2. **Build a `HookCtx` per provider** by merging the caller's `base` context with the
   provider's YAML `config`, the provider's clamped `budget.maxTokens`, and the gateway
   coordinates from `gatewayInfo()`. The full `HookCtx` shape:

   ```ts
   interface HookCtx {
     sessionId: string; projectId?: string; scope: "project" | "global"; cwd: string;
     goalId?: string; roleName?: string; prompt?: string; turn?: { index: number };
     budget: { maxTokens: number };
     config: Record<string, unknown>;
     runtime?: { baseUrl: string; headers: Record<string, string>; status: string };
     gateway: { baseUrl: string; token: string };
   }
   ```
3. **Invoke each provider on the worker tier.** It calls `moduleHost.invoke({ exportKind:
   "providers", member: hook, url, packRoot, epoch, ctx, arg })` with the provider's
   `budget.timeoutMs` as the per-provider timeout. The worker resolves the module's hook from
   the **default-export object** (see [provider module contract](#provider-module-contract)).
4. **Collect + validate + force provenance** on the returned blocks (per the rules above).
5. **Apply budgets** across all collected blocks — per-provider maxima from each provider's
   budget, global from `globalMaxTokens`.
6. **Write one trace row** for the dispatch.
7. **Return** the kept blocks plus a list of diagnostics. `dispatch` **never throws** because
   of a provider — provider faults become diagnostics.

### Diagnostics — one bad provider never breaks the rest

`dispatch` returns a `HubDiagnostic[]` alongside the kept blocks:

```ts
interface HubDiagnostic {
  providerId: string;
  hook: LifecycleHook;
  error?: string;    // thrown-error message, or "malformed block(s) dropped"
  timeout?: boolean; // true when the per-provider timeout fired
  ms: number;        // how long the provider's invocation took
}
```

- **Timeout** — a provider that exceeds its `budget.timeoutMs` is terminated by the worker host;
  the Hub records `{ timeout: true }` and moves on. The other providers are unaffected, and the
  whole dispatch stays fast (the timeout bounds it).
- **Throw** — an exception in provider code becomes `{ error: message }`; no crash.
- **Malformed** — invalid blocks are dropped and the provider gets `{ error: "malformed
  block(s) dropped" }` while its valid blocks still flow through.

### Provider module contract

A provider module is authored as a **default-export object** whose members are the hook
handlers — *not* a named `providers` export. Each handler is `async (ctx) => { blocks: [...] }`
(it may also return a bare `ContextBlock[]`):

```js
// providers/memory.mjs
export default {
  async sessionSetup(ctx) {
    return {
      blocks: [
        {
          id: "recent-decisions",
          title: "Project memory",
          authority: "memory",
          content: "…",
          reason: "surfacing recent decisions for continuity",
          priority: 10,
          // tokenEstimate is recomputed host-side; providerId is forced.
        },
      ],
    };
  },
  async beforePrompt(ctx) { /* … */ },
};
```

This is why the worker's member-resolution has an explicit `providers` branch: for
`exportKind: "providers"` the hook *group* is the **default export object itself**
(`mod.default ?? mod`), and the hook name is one of its members. For `actions`/`routes` the
group is still `mod[exportKind] ?? mod.default?.[exportKind]` — that path is unchanged, so the
existing route/action dispatchers are unaffected.

## Session-setup wiring (G1.3)

This is the **first** place the Hub is actually called from a live session path. The wiring has
three moving parts; the goal was to add session behaviour without changing the prompt for any
session that has no active provider.

### Where the Hub is constructed

Exactly **one** `LifecycleHub` instance lives for the gateway's lifetime. It is built in the
server bootstrap (`src/server/server.ts`) right after the `PackContributionRegistry`, because the
Hub's dependencies (`registry`, `moduleHost`) only exist at that point, and assigned to the
already-constructed `SessionManager` via a public `lifecycleHub` field (the same
assigned-post-construction pattern as `sandboxTokenStore` / `configCascade`). Its `gatewayInfo`
callback reads the gateway base URL and admin token the same way the tool-guard does
(`BOBBIT_GATEWAY_URL` env or `state/gateway-url`; token from `state/token`), guarded so a missing
file never throws.

### Where the hook is dispatched

The session-setup pipeline (`src/server/agent/session-setup.ts`) gains one new async step,
`resolveDynamicContext`, dispatched immediately **before** `resolvePrompt` in both the synchronous
(`executePlan`) and worktree-async (`executeWorktreeAsync`) paths. It:

1. **Short-circuits to zero cost when no Hub is configured** (`if (!ctx.lifecycleHub) return;`).
   A session with no providers therefore pays nothing — this is what keeps spawn latency unchanged
   and the prompt byte-identical for the no-provider / schema-1 case.
2. Otherwise calls `lifecycleHub.dispatch("sessionSetup", { sessionId, projectId, scope, cwd,
   goalId, roleName, prompt })` (scope is `"project"` when the plan has a `projectId`, else
   `"global"`; `prompt` is the delegate task prompt when present, best-effort otherwise) and
   stashes the returned `blocks` on the plan as `dynamicContextBlocks`.
3. **Wraps the whole step in try/catch — a provider fault is logged and the spawn proceeds.**
   Dynamic context is ambient and optional; a throwing or slow provider must never block a session
   from starting. (The Hub already fault-isolates *individual* providers into diagnostics; this
   outer guard covers the dispatch call itself.)

The blocks are stashed on the **plan**, not applied directly, because `resolvePrompt` is
re-invoked on the cwd-rebind path. `_resolvePrompt` copies `plan.dynamicContextBlocks` into
`PromptParts.dynamicContext` on **every** invocation, so the blocks survive the re-calls —
dispatch once, re-apply many.

### How the blocks reach the prompt and the inspector

`system-prompt.ts` renders `PromptParts.dynamicContext` (when non-empty) as a **final** section,
after every existing section. It is placed last deliberately: provider-supplied ambient context is
the freshest, **lowest-authority** content, so it sits at the tail where it least disturbs the
cache-friendly stable prefix. Each block is wrapped with `fenceBlock` (the `<context-block …>`
envelope carrying `source` / `authority` / `reason` provenance) and the blocks are joined with
`\n\n`.

The section is added in **both** prompt builders, mirroring the skills-catalog duality:

- `_assembleSystemPrompt` (the actual system prompt) prepends a `## Dynamic Context` header.
- `getPromptSections` (the source for the prompt-sections inspector) emits
  `{ label: "Dynamic Context", source: "providers", content, tokens }`, where `content` is exactly
  the fenced blocks (no header) and `tokens` is the host-side estimate. Because
  `persistPromptSections` consumes `getPromptSections`, the section appears in the inspector
  (`GET /api/sessions/:id/prompt-sections`) **for free**, with `source: "providers"` provenance and
  a token count; per-block `provider` / `reason` / token live inside the fence attributes.

**Empty / absent `dynamicContext` adds zero sections**, so a session with no contributing provider
produces a byte-identical prompt to before this wiring — the invariant a unit test pins.

### What ships out of the box

The [Hindsight memory pack](hindsight-memory.md) ships in the built-in band as the first production
provider, but it is **dormant until a Hindsight URL is configured** — so a fresh install contributes
no Dynamic Context until you opt in. The wiring itself is also exercised by a
deterministic fixture pack, `tests/fixtures/packs/provider-demo/`, whose `sessionSetup` returns a
`DEMO_SETUP_BLOCK` and a throwing variant proves the failure path still spawns the session. The
E2E test (`tests/e2e/provider-session-setup.spec.ts`) **copies that fixture into the per-gateway
server-scope market-packs dir** (`.bobbit/config/market-packs/provider-demo/`) and toggles it via
pack activation (`PUT /api/marketplace/pack-activation`), which invalidates the resolver caches.
This layers the fixture *on top of* the real built-in band rather than replacing it — the earlier
approach of pointing `BOBBIT_BUILTIN_PACKS_DIR` at the fixtures dir wiped the built-in band for
the whole worker-scoped gateway and broke sibling specs. Installing any schema-2 pack that ships a
`sessionSetup` provider will likewise contribute a Dynamic Context section.

## Per-turn + lifecycle wiring (G1.4)

G1.4 wires the remaining four hooks. They divide cleanly by **where they have to run**, and that
division dictates the mechanism:

| Hook | Mechanism | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `afterTurn` | Gateway-internal, fire-and-forget. | A turn-complete signal; nothing to inject, so no agent round-trip is needed. |
| `sessionShutdown` | Gateway-internal, awaited-with-timeout. | Lets providers flush durable state before teardown; the gateway already owns the archive path. |
| `beforePrompt` | In-process provider-bridge extension. | Must inject ambient recall into *this turn's* prompt, which only the agent process can see. |
| `beforeCompact` | In-process provider-bridge extension. | Must fire at the agent's compaction moment, which the gateway does not observe directly. |

### Server-side hooks: `afterTurn` and `sessionShutdown`

These fire from the gateway's existing agent-event stream — no agent round-trip and no public
endpoint (they are not reachable over REST by design; only the gateway dispatches them):

- **`afterTurn`** — dispatched from `handleAgentLifecycle`'s `agent_end` branch in
  `session-manager.ts`. pi does not surface a granular `turn_end` in the gateway's event stream,
  so `agent_end` (turn complete) is the dispatch point. It is **fire-and-forget**: the dispatch
  is `void`-ed (never awaited into the event path) and its rejection is caught and logged, so a
  slow or throwing provider can never stall the lifecycle. The `turn.index` passed is the
  session's running completed-turn count. Per-provider timeouts are still enforced inside the
  Hub.
- **`sessionShutdown`** — dispatched from the session archive path (`archiveWithCascade` and the
  `terminateSession` archive path) in `session-manager.ts`, **awaited with a timeout** so
  providers get a bounded window to flush before teardown proceeds. Failures are caught and
  logged; archive always proceeds.

### Per-turn hooks: the provider-bridge extension

The per-turn hooks need to run *inside* the agent process so they can amend the outgoing turn.
The gateway can't reach into that process, so Bobbit **generates a pi-coding-agent extension**
that subscribes to pi's per-turn events and calls back into the gateway. See
[The provider-bridge extension](#the-provider-bridge-extension) below for the codegen, transport,
and the non-negotiable injection invariant.

### The REST surface

Three endpoints back the per-turn hooks and diagnostics. They live in one contiguous block in
`server.ts`, modeled on `POST /api/sessions/:id/tool-grant-request`, and **inherit the
admin-bearer auth gate enforced before `handleApiRoute`** — no extra auth code. All are keyed by
session id and `404` when the session is unknown (neither live nor persisted).

| Method + path | Caller | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /api/sessions/:id/provider-hooks/before-prompt` | provider-bridge extension | Body `{ prompt?, turn?: { index } }`. Dispatches `beforePrompt`; responds `{ tail, blocks }`. |
| `POST /api/sessions/:id/provider-hooks/before-compact` | provider-bridge extension | Dispatches `beforeCompact` and responds `{}` once provider flushes settle (bounded by per-provider timeouts). |
| `GET /api/sessions/:id/context-trace?limit=N` | inspector / diagnostics | Returns `{ entries }` from the [trace store](#the-trace-store), oldest→newest; `limit` keeps the most recent N (clamped to 1000). |

**`before-prompt` response shape.** `tail` is the fenced blocks joined inside the
dynamic-context delimiters, or `""` when no block survived budgeting:

```
\n<!-- bobbit:dynamic-context:start -->
<context-block …>…</context-block>

<context-block …>…</context-block>
<!-- bobbit:dynamic-context:end -->
```

`blocks` is **metadata-only** — each entry is `{ id, providerId, title, tokenEstimate }`. The
full block content lives inside the fenced `tail`; the metadata array exists for the inspector
and for diagnostics without re-sending the body. After dispatch the endpoint also refreshes the
persisted prompt-sections snapshot **best-effort** (non-fatal: a failure is logged and the
response still returns) so `GET /api/sessions/:id/prompt-sections` reflects the turn's
dynamic-context tail.

When no `LifecycleHub` is configured, `before-prompt` returns `{ tail: "", blocks: [] }` and
`before-compact` returns `{}` — the turn proceeds unchanged.

## The provider-bridge extension

`provider-bridge-extension.ts` generates a small pi-coding-agent extension
(`generateProviderBridgeExtension(sessionId): string` → TS source;
`writeProviderBridgeExtension(sessionId): string | undefined` → file path). It mirrors
`tool-guard-extension.ts`'s codegen, caching, and content-addressed file handling — the file is
written under `.bobbit/state/provider-bridge/<contentHash>/bridge.ts` and de-duplicated by
hash.

The generated extension subscribes to two pi events:

- **`before_agent_start`** (per turn) → POST `…/provider-hooks/before-prompt` with
  `{ prompt: event.prompt }`, with an `AbortController` timeout of **2500 ms**. On success it
  returns `{ systemPrompt: stripDelimitedTail(event.systemPrompt) + resp.tail }`. On **any**
  failure (transport, timeout/abort, non-2xx, parse error) it returns `undefined` and the turn
  proceeds with the unmodified prompt.
- **`session_before_compact`** → POST `…/provider-hooks/before-compact`, with a timeout of
  **5000 ms**. The result is ignored (compaction output is not amended here); all failures are
  swallowed.

Transport and auth are identical to the tool-guard: read `BOBBIT_GATEWAY_URL` / `BOBBIT_TOKEN`
from the environment, falling back to `<BOBBIT_DIR || ~/.bobbit>/state/{gateway-url,token}`, and
`fetch` the gateway with a bearer token. A missing gateway URL short-circuits to "proceed
unchanged".

### The injection invariant (non-negotiable)

> **The user's message text is NEVER mutated.** Per-turn recall is injected only into the
> outgoing **system-prompt tail**.

This is a hard correctness boundary, not a style preference. Mutating the user prompt would
corrupt the transcript echo and re-open the comms-stack optimistic-reconciliation **duplicate**
class. The bridge forwards `event.prompt` to the gateway **read-only** and only ever returns a
modified `systemPrompt`. A test pins that the user's message text is byte-identical with and
without the bridge.

pi's `before_agent_start` event exposes both `prompt: string` and `systemPrompt: string`, and
`BeforeAgentStartEventResult` accepts `systemPrompt?: string`, so the bridge takes the simple,
verified path: read `event.systemPrompt`, strip any prior delimited tail, append the fresh tail,
return `{ systemPrompt }`.

### Idempotent, delimited tail

The dynamic-context region is wrapped in delimiters that **must stay byte-identical** between
`provider-bridge-extension.ts` and the `before-prompt` endpoint in `server.ts`:

```
<!-- bobbit:dynamic-context:start -->
…fenced context-blocks…
<!-- bobbit:dynamic-context:end -->
```

Each turn the bridge calls `stripDelimitedTail(systemPrompt)` to remove any prior region
(including a truncated, end-delimiter-less one) and then appends the fresh tail. Applying
strip-then-append repeatedly yields **exactly one** delimited region — the tail never grows
turn-over-turn. This idempotency is unit-pinned. The strip helper is duplicated (host-side TS
export + inlined JS in the generated extension) precisely so the two copies can be kept in sync;
the delimiters are the contract between them.

### Activation — generated only when a provider wants it

The bridge is generated and pushed onto the agent's `--extension` spawn args **only when at least
one enabled provider for the session's project declares `beforePrompt` or `beforeCompact`**
(`hasProviderBridgeHooks(hub, projectId)`, which delegates to `hub.hasProvidersForHooks(...)` so
activation filtering stays centralized in the registry). Disabled providers are dropped by the
registry before this check, so toggling a provider off is a working kill switch — the next spawn
omits the bridge entirely.

When no provider is interested, nothing is generated or pushed: **zero overhead and spawn args
byte-identical to the no-provider baseline** (pinned by the codegen test). The activation check
lives in two places that both spawn agents — `session-setup.ts::resolveToolActivation` (initial
spawn, after the tool-guard `--extension` push) and the respawn/restore path in
`session-manager.ts`. **Both** re-run the check so the bridge is **restored on respawn and
gateway restart**; otherwise per-turn hooks would silently stop firing after a restart. The
`.bobbit/state/provider-bridge/` directory is on the archive allowlist so the generated bridge
survives session archive/restore.

### Security note — TLS

The generated bridge **does not touch TLS verification**. It relies on the spawner's inherited
environment: the local gateway's CA cert is pinned via `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` when present (with
the spawner's existing fallback only when no CA cert exists). An earlier revision set a
process-wide TLS downgrade in the generated code; that was removed because it would defeat the
pinned-CA path and disable verification for **all** of the agent's outbound HTTPS — not just the
gateway callback. Never reintroduce a global TLS downgrade in the bridge.

## The trace store

`ContextTraceStore` records each dispatch as one JSON line, so you can reconstruct exactly what
ambient context a session received and why blocks were dropped.

- **Location:** `<stateDir>/session-context-trace/<sessionId>.jsonl` (the directory is created
  lazily; the session id is sanitised to a safe basename). This mirrors the `bg-process` state
  layout under the state dir.
- **Entry shape** (`appendTrace(sessionId, entry)`):

  ```ts
  interface TraceEntry {
    ts: number;          // epoch ms
    hook: string;        // the dispatched hook
    sessionId: string;
    providers: {
      id: string;        // provider id
      ms: number;        // invocation duration
      blocks: number;    // blocks KEPT after budgeting
      omitted: number;   // budget-omitted + malformed-dropped count
      error?: string;    // error / "timeout" / "malformed block(s) dropped"
    }[];
  }
  ```
- **Reads:** `readTrace(sessionId, limit?)` returns entries oldest→newest; `limit` keeps the
  most recent N. Corrupt/partial lines are skipped rather than failing the read.
- **Size cap:** the file is capped at **2 MB**. On append, if the file exceeds the cap it is
  rewritten keeping only the newest lines that fit (drop-oldest), via a temp-file rename so a
  reader never sees a half-written file.

## Status / wiring roadmap

- **G1.2** delivered the **server core**: the modules above plus the `"providers"` `exportKind`
  branch on the Extension Host worker seam.
- **G1.3 (done)** constructs the single Hub at gateway bootstrap and calls
  `dispatch("sessionSetup", …)` during session setup, rendering kept blocks as the
  `PromptParts.dynamicContext` → **Dynamic Context** system-prompt section — see
  [Session-setup wiring (G1.3)](#session-setup-wiring-g13).
- **G1.4 (done)** wires the remaining four hooks: the per-turn `beforePrompt` / `beforeCompact`
  via the generated [provider-bridge extension](#the-provider-bridge-extension), and the
  server-side `afterTurn` / `sessionShutdown` from the gateway's agent-event stream; plus the
  REST surface (`/provider-hooks/*`, `/context-trace`) — see
  [Per-turn + lifecycle wiring (G1.4)](#per-turn--lifecycle-wiring-g14).
- **G2** ships the first built-in production provider, the [Hindsight memory pack](hindsight-memory.md).
  It is dormant until a Hindsight URL is configured, so out of the box behaviour is unchanged —
  with no active provider, no Dynamic Context section is added and the per-turn bridge is never
  spawned.- Selector hooks (`beforeGoalCreate` / `beforeSessionSpawn`) are a separate, later goal (G8).
