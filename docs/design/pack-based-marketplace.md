# Pack-Based Marketplace — Design Document

Status: **design** (MVP implementation to follow)
Owner: Pack-Based Marketplace goal (`goal/pack-based-mar-6828576e`)
Scope: unify the **installable-entity resolvers** (roles, tools, skills) into **one pack resolver over one ordered list of packs**, and add a **Market** surface to register sources and install/uninstall/update packs.

> This document is implementable on its own. It encodes the goal's *locked decisions verbatim* and is deliberately precise about the **legacy → unified-list mapping** (§6), which is the highest regression risk.

---

## 0. TL;DR / mental model

- A **pack is a directory** laid out like `defaults/`: `roles/`, `tools/`, `skills/` (and a future `mcp/`).
- There is **ONE resolver** that walks **ONE ordered list of packs** low→high priority and produces resolved entities, each tagged with the pack it came from. **Precedence = position in the list.**
- **Everything is a pack** in that list:
  - **Builtin pack** — shipped `dist/server/defaults/` (read-only, lowest priority).
  - **User packs** — each scope's existing `roles/ tools/ skills/` dir; where create/customize writes, revert deletes.
  - **Market packs** — installed from a source into a scope's `market-packs/<pack-name>/`.
  - **Legacy-implicit packs** — the hard-coded skill scan dirs and user-registered `config_directories` mapped into list entries (back-compat).
- **Install** = copy a pack dir into a scope's `market-packs/` + write `.pack-meta.yaml`. **Uninstall** = delete the dir. **Update** = re-copy/re-pull.
- **Out of scope, untouched:** `mcp-manager.ts` (MCP servers) and `system-prompt.ts` (AGENTS.md). Leave loader seams only.

The reframe must produce **byte-for-byte identical resolution** for roles/tools/skills versus today's `ConfigCascade` + `slash-skills.ts` + `config_directories`. The existing tests pin this.

---

## 1. Pack model & layout

### 1.1 What a pack is

A pack is a directory containing a **required `pack.yaml`** manifest plus an entity-payload subtree laid out exactly like Bobbit's `defaults/`:

```
<pack-dir>/
  pack.yaml                       # REQUIRED — a dir is a pack IFF this exists
  roles/<name>.yaml
  tools/<group>/{*.yaml, extension.ts, _shared/...}
  skills/<name>/SKILL.md
  (mcp/ ...)                      # future — loader seam reserved, not loaded in MVP
```

**Discovery rule (single source of truth):** a directory is a pack **iff** it contains `pack.yaml`. Directories without one are ignored (e.g. a source repo's `README.md`, a `docs/` folder). The **builtin pack** and **legacy-implicit packs** are the only exceptions — they have an *implicit* manifest synthesised in code (no file on disk).

### 1.2 Marketplace source repo layout

A source is a git repo (or local dir) whose **top level is a collection of pack directories** — never a flat `defaults/` mirror. One repo may hold many packs.

```
<source-repo-root>/
  research-pack/
    pack.yaml
    roles/researcher.yaml
    tools/research/{web-deep.yaml, extension.ts}
    skills/lit-review/SKILL.md
  qa-pack/
    pack.yaml
    roles/qa-runner.yaml
    tools/qa/...
  README.md                       # ignored (no pack.yaml)
```

### 1.3 Installation layout (per scope)

Installing copies a pack subtree verbatim into the chosen scope's `market-packs/<pack-name>/`, adding a generated `.pack-meta.yaml`. Each scope's own `roles/ tools/ skills/` IS that scope's **user pack**.

Every scope's **user-pack root is `<base>/.bobbit/config/`** and its **market-packs root is the sibling `<base>/.bobbit/config/market-packs/`**, where `base` is the homedir / server cwd / project root. This is *normalized across all three scopes* so install and resolution always derive the same root (see §1.3.1). `base` per scope: global-user = `~`, server = `<server-cwd>`, project = `<project>`.

```
dist/server/defaults/                       # BUILTIN PACK (read-only, lowest priority)
  roles/  tools/  skills/

~/.bobbit/config/                           # GLOBAL-USER scope
  roles/  tools/  skills/                    #   ← user pack (created/customized entities)
  market-packs/<pack-name>/...               #   ← installed market packs

<server-cwd>/.bobbit/config/                # SERVER scope
  roles/  tools/  skills/                    #   ← user pack
  market-packs/<pack-name>/...

<project>/.bobbit/config/                   # PROJECT scope (highest priority)
  roles/  tools/  skills/                    #   ← user pack
  market-packs/<pack-name>/...
```

#### 1.3.1 `scopeRoot` vs `userPackRoot` (resolved consistently)

To avoid install/resolution scanning different roots, the data model defines two derived paths **per scope** from a single `base`:

```ts
function scopePaths(scope, base): { userPackRoot: string; marketPacksRoot: string } {
  const cfg = path.join(base, ".bobbit", "config");      // = bobbit-dir.ts configDir(base)
  return { userPackRoot: cfg, marketPacksRoot: path.join(cfg, "market-packs") };
}
// global-user base = os.homedir(); server base = <server-cwd>; project base = <project root>
```

- `userPackRoot` is **exactly** the dir `RoleStore`/`ToolManager` already use today (`<base>/.bobbit/config`) for project and server scopes — so byte-identical roles/tools resolution holds (global-user is empty today). `buildPackList()` and `installPack()` both derive paths via `scopePaths`, never independently.
- **Reconciliation with the goal spec's illustrative layout:** the goal spec sketched server/global-user roots without the `/config` segment (`<server-cwd>/.bobbit/`, `~/.bobbit/`). We deliberately normalize to `<base>/.bobbit/config/` for all scopes because that is where the existing stores read/write; using the spec's bare paths would split install vs resolution roots and break byte-identical resolution. The Claude-compatible **skill** dirs (`~/.bobbit/skills`, `~/.claude/skills`, `<project>/.bobbit/skills`, `<project>/.claude/skills`, `<project>/.claude/commands`) are unaffected — they remain referenced in place as legacy-implicit entries (§6.2), not under `config/`.

### 1.4 `pack.yaml` schema

Authored by a pack publisher; copied verbatim on install.

```yaml
# pack.yaml — REQUIRED in every pack directory
name: research-pack              # REQUIRED. Unique pack id within a scope's market-packs/.
                                 #   [a-z0-9-]+; used as the install dir name.
description: >                   # REQUIRED. One-paragraph human summary (shown in browse UI).
  Deep-research role, web tools, and a literature-review skill.
version: 1.2.0                   # REQUIRED. Semver string. Informational + shown in provenance.
author: jane@example.com         # OPTIONAL.
homepage: https://...            # OPTIONAL.
# Declared contents — what the pack ships. REQUIRED. Drives the browse UI
# (declared-entity chips). All three keys MUST be present; each is an array
# that MAY be empty. The resolver loads whatever is physically present, but
# `contents` is the authoritative advertised manifest the UI renders.
# (No per-pack "executable code" gate keys off tools[]: trust is handled
#  once at the source-add boundary — see §10.2.)
contents:
  roles:  [researcher]
  tools:  [research]             # tool GROUP names (dir names under tools/)
  skills: [lit-review]
```

> **Pack-schema V1 addition.** `contents` also accepts an optional **`entrypoints: string[]`**
> key (basenames of `entrypoints/<name>.yaml` files), and `pack.yaml` accepts an optional
> top-level **`routes: { module, names }`** block. Both belong to the
> [Extension Host](extension-host-authoring.md); they extend (do not replace) the resolver
> schema below. Extension-Host **panels** are auto-discovered from `panels/*.yaml` and are not
> listed in `contents`; **stores** are implicit (no key); there is **no `permissions` key**.
> The authoritative schema is
> [pack-schema-v1-rationalisation.md](pack-schema-v1-rationalisation.md). The
> roles/tools/skills resolver semantics in this doc are unchanged.

TypeScript shape (parser output):

```ts
export interface PackManifest {
  name: string;
  description: string;
  version: string;
  author?: string;
  homepage?: string;
  // REQUIRED object; the roles/tools/skills array keys REQUIRED but MAY be empty.
  // NO `mcp` key in a publishable manifest — packs may NOT ship/install MCP
  // configs (goal MVP boundary). `mcp` exists only as a reserved code-level
  // EntityType (§2.2) for the future loader seam, never in a published pack.yaml.
  contents: {
    roles: string[];
    tools: string[];          // tool group dir names
    skills: string[];
    entrypoints?: string[];   // V1: Extension-Host entrypoints/<name>.yaml basenames
  };
  // V1: optional Extension-Host pack-level routes (see pack-schema-v1-rationalisation.md).
  routes?: { module?: string; names?: string[] };
}
```

Validation: `name` must match `/^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*$/` (used as a directory name; reject path separators, `..`, leading dot — reuse `isSafeRelPath`-style guarding). `description` and `version` non-empty. `contents` REQUIRED with the `roles`/`tools`/`skills` array keys present (each may be empty); `contents.entrypoints` and the top-level `routes:` block are optional (V1). A `contents.mcp` key in a published manifest is **rejected** in MVP (MCP installs out of scope). Other unknown top-level keys ignored (forward-compat). A pack whose `pack.yaml` is missing or fails validation is **skipped with a warning**, not fatal.

### 1.5 `.pack-meta.yaml` schema

Generated at install time **inside the installed pack dir**. Records provenance. Never authored by publishers.

```yaml
# .pack-meta.yaml — generated at install (do not hand-edit)
sourceUrl: https://github.com/acme/bobbit-packs.git  # origin source (git URL or local path)
sourceRef: main                  # branch/tag requested
commit: 9f3c1a8                  # resolved commit SHA at install/update (empty for local-dir sources)
packName: research-pack          # echoes pack.yaml name (sanity / rename detection)
version: 1.2.0                   # echoes pack.yaml version at install time
installedAt: 2026-06-03T10:21:00Z
updatedAt: 2026-06-03T10:21:00Z  # equals installedAt until first update
scope: project                   # "global-user" | "server" | "project"
```

```ts
export interface PackMeta {
  sourceUrl: string;
  sourceRef: string;
  commit: string;
  packName: string;
  version: string;
  installedAt: string;  // ISO-8601
  updatedAt: string;    // ISO-8601
  scope: PackScope;
}
```

> The pack dir + its `.pack-meta.yaml` IS the install record. **No separate per-entity provenance ledger.** Uninstall = delete the dir.

---

## 2. The single resolver — one pipeline, pluggable loaders

### 2.1 Ordered list data structure

```ts
export type PackScope = "builtin" | "global-user" | "server" | "project";
export type PackKind  = "builtin" | "user" | "market" | "legacy-implicit";

/** One entry in the single ordered pack list. */
export interface PackEntry {
  id: string;                 // stable id: builtin | user:<scope> | market:<scope>:<name> | legacy:<hash>
  kind: PackKind;
  scope: PackScope;
  path: string;               // absolute dir whose roles/ tools/ skills/ subtree is loaded
  readOnly: boolean;          // builtin + legacy-implicit + claude-compat dirs ⇒ true
  manifest?: PackManifest;    // present for market packs (+ synthesised for builtin)
  meta?: PackMeta;            // present for installed market packs
  /** For legacy-implicit skill dirs: restrict which entity types this entry contributes. */
  onlyTypes?: EntityType[];   // e.g. ["skills"] for .claude/skills
  /** Layout flavour: how to read this dir. */
  layout: "defaults-tree" | "skills-flat" | "commands-flat";
}
```

`layout` distinguishes the three physical shapes the resolver must read:
- `defaults-tree` — the canonical pack/`defaults/` shape (`roles/`, `tools/<group>/`, `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`). Used by builtin, user packs, market packs, and the `.bobbit/skills` / `~/.bobbit/skills` / `.claude/skills` / `~/.claude/skills` skill dirs *(see note below)*.
- `skills-flat` — a directory that is itself a `skills/` root, i.e. `<dir>/<name>/SKILL.md` (the hard-coded skill scan dirs and user `config_directories` skill entries point directly at a skills root, not a pack root).
- `commands-flat` — `.claude/commands/*.md` (legacy slash commands).

> Most legacy skill dirs are `skills-flat`: the path *is* the skills root. A pack's `skills/` is one level deeper. This is why `layout` exists rather than forcing every legacy dir to look like a full pack.

### 2.2 Loader interface (pluggable, type-specific)

The pipeline owns ordering/precedence/origin. Each entity type plugs in a loader that knows how to read its files from a pack entry. Adding `mcp/` or a future `panels/` type is **adding a loader**, not touching the ordering core.

```ts
export type EntityType = "roles" | "tools" | "skills"; // + "mcp" | "panels" later

/** A loaded entity before precedence merge. */
export interface LoadedEntity<T> {
  name: string;          // merge key (unique within a type)
  item: T;               // the parsed entity (Role | ToolInfo | SlashSkill | ...)
}

/** Type-specific reader. Pure: (entry) → entities. No precedence logic here. */
export interface EntityLoader<T> {
  type: EntityType;
  /** Does this loader run for this entry's layout? e.g. skills loader handles all
   *  three layouts; roles/tools loaders only handle defaults-tree. */
  supports(entry: PackEntry): boolean;
  load(entry: PackEntry): LoadedEntity<T>[];
}
```

> **Non-installable `ConfigCascade` types stay on the existing path.** `ConfigCascade` today resolves four things: roles, tools, **workflows**, and **tool-group policies**. Only **roles and tools** are migrated to route through `PackResolver` (via the loaders below). `ConfigCascade.resolveWorkflows` and `ConfigCascade.resolveToolGroupPolicies` are **left untouched** — they keep their current implementations and are NOT routed through the pack resolver (there are no workflow/policy loaders). Practically, `ConfigCascade` retains those two methods unchanged while `resolveRoles`/`resolveTools` become adapters over `PackResolver`. This prevents accidentally routing a type that has no loader into the resolver, and preserves byte-identical workflow/policy resolution.

Concrete loaders (MVP):
- `RoleLoader` — reads `<path>/roles/*.yaml` (only `defaults-tree`). Parsing reuses the YAML→`Role` logic currently in `BuiltinConfigProvider.loadRoles` / `RoleStore` (factor into a shared `parseRoleYaml`).
- `ToolLoader` — reads `<path>/tools/<group>/*.yaml` + flat `<path>/tools/*.yaml` (only `defaults-tree`). Reuses `BuiltinConfigProvider.loadTools` grouped+flat two-pass logic into a shared `parseToolsDir`. Tool **extension.ts / _shared** code travels with the dir on install but is loaded by the existing tool-execution machinery, not the resolver.
- `SkillLoader` — reads SKILL.md/commands. Handles all three layouts:
  - `defaults-tree` → scan `<path>/skills/` (each subdir's `SKILL.md`).
  - `skills-flat` → scan `<path>/` directly (each subdir's `SKILL.md`).
  - `commands-flat` → scan `<path>/*.md`.
  Reuses `scanSkillDir` / `scanCommandsDir` / `parseFrontmatter` from `slash-skills.ts`.

### 2.3 The pipeline (one resolver, not several)

```ts
export interface ResolvedEntity<T> {
  item: T;
  origin: PackEntry;          // the winning pack
  shadows: PackEntry[];       // lower-priority packs that defined the same name (for conflict UI)
}

export class PackResolver {
  constructor(private entries: PackEntry[], private loaders: EntityLoader<any>[]) {}

  /** entries are ordered low→high priority. */
  resolve<T>(type: EntityType): ResolvedEntity<T>[] {
    const byName = new Map<string, ResolvedEntity<T>>();
    for (const entry of this.entries) {                 // low → high
      if (entry.onlyTypes && !entry.onlyTypes.includes(type)) continue;
      for (const loader of this.loaders) {
        if (loader.type !== type || !loader.supports(entry)) continue;
        for (const { name, item } of loader.load(entry)) {
          const prev = byName.get(name);
          byName.set(name, {
            item,
            origin: entry,
            shadows: prev ? [...prev.shadows, prev.origin] : [],
          });
        }
      }
    }
    return [...byName.values()];
  }
}
```

Key properties:
- **One traversal, all types.** Same ordered list, same shadow rule, for roles/tools/skills (and future types).
- A later (higher-priority) entry **shadows** an earlier same-name entry. The shadowed entries are retained in `shadows[]` so the marketplace manager can render conflict warnings (§4) and the config pages can render `origin`/`overrides` badges (§5).
- This is the **single** resolver. `ConfigCascade.resolveRoles`/`resolveTools` and `discoverSlashSkills` become thin adapters over it (§6). `ConfigCascade.resolveWorkflows`/`resolveToolGroupPolicies` are **not** adapted — those non-installable types keep their existing implementations (§2.2 note); there are no workflow/policy loaders.

---

## 3. Scope order & within-scope ordering

### 3.1 Base scope order (LOCKED)

```
builtin  <  server  <  global-user  <  project
```

Lowest → highest priority. Project wins; a user's machine-wide (global-user) packs beat a shared server install; builtin is lowest.

> ⚠️ Naming reconciliation: today's `ConfigResolver`/`ConfigCascade` uses the order **builtin < server < project** and treats "global" as a *tier* (`~/.bobbit`). The locked order inserts **global-user between server and project**. This matches `config-resolver.ts`'s documented intent (`global → server → project` for entities) **except** the cascade currently only wires builtin/server/project for roles+tools. The unified list makes global-user a first-class segment. **Back-compat is preserved because today no roles/tools are resolved from `~/.bobbit/{roles,tools}` at all** (the cascade never reads them) — so adding the global-user segment below project and above server cannot change any *currently-resolved* role/tool. For skills, `~/.claude/skills` and `~/.bobbit/skills` are personal (global-user) and today sit *below* project skills — preserved (see §6).

### 3.2 Within-scope ordering

Within a single scope segment, entries are ordered low→high as:

```
[ market packs, in pack_order ]  <  [ user pack ]  <  [ legacy-implicit skill dirs (skills only) ]
```

Rationale and rules:
- **User-authored content is the HIGHEST writable layer within its scope.** The user pack sits **above** market packs in the same scope. This is required to keep customize/revert reliable: customizing an entity writes into the scope's user pack, which then shadows any market pack in that scope; reverting deletes the user-pack file and the market entity reappears. (Cross-scope, a higher scope still wins overall — a project user pack beats a server market pack because the whole project segment is above the whole server segment.)

  > Worked: a project-scope market pack ships role `researcher`. The user customizes it → a file is written to `<project>/.bobbit/config/roles/researcher.yaml` (the project user pack), which is above the market pack in the project segment → the customization wins. Revert deletes that file → the market pack's `researcher` resolves again. No precedence ambiguity.
- **Market vs market within a scope:** ordered by the scope's **`pack_order`** list (§3.3) — default is install order (oldest first ⇒ lowest priority; newest install shadows older). User-reorderable; this is the sole configured conflict-resolution mechanism in MVP.
- **Legacy-implicit entries** slot into the scope segment that matches their physical location (§6.2): project-scoped legacy dirs into the project segment, personal/home dirs into global-user. They are skills-only (`onlyTypes:["skills"]`) and placed **above** the user pack within their segment, exactly reproducing today's "project/personal skills beat everything" precedence (see the exact placement table in §6.2). For skills there is no separate writable "user pack" today — the legacy skill dirs *are* the user-authored skill content, so their §6.2 order is authoritative and unchanged.

### 3.3 Precedence-config persistence

**MVP ships exactly ONE configured conflict-resolution mechanism: `pack_order`** — per-scope ordering of market packs. Persisted in **project config (`project.yaml`) for project scope**, and in **server config (`<server-cwd>/.bobbit/config/project.yaml`)** for server/global scope (reusing the existing `ProjectConfigStore` surface):

**Persistence shape (scoped, not flat).** `pack_order` is a map keyed by scope so independent scopes never collide — critical because **server and global-user both persist in the server config file** and could otherwise not be represented separately:

```yaml
# Persisted as a migrated native-YAML field (mirror config_directories side-table).
# Each scope's market-pack order, highest priority LAST. Unknown/uninstalled names ignored.
pack_order:
  server:      [shared-pack]
  global-user: [research-pack, qa-pack]
  project:     [research-pack]
```

- **Where each scope's order lives:** the `project` key persists in `<project>/.bobbit/config/project.yaml`; the `server` and `global-user` keys persist in the **server config** (`<server-cwd>/.bobbit/config/project.yaml`) under the same `pack_order` map but distinct keys, so the two share a file yet stay independent. `buildPackList()` reads each scope's order from the correct store.
- `pack_order[scope]` is the **sole** conflict mechanism: reorder market packs within a scope (mirrors the existing project drag-reorder pattern). Implemented as a new migrated field on `ProjectConfigStore` (follow the `config_directories` native-YAML side-table precedent — see `project-config-store.ts`). The last entry has highest priority within the scope's market-pack band. A name present in `market-packs/` but absent from `pack_order[scope]` defaults to lowest priority (sorted before listed entries, by install order); a name in `pack_order[scope]` not on disk is ignored.
- Read/write over REST via `GET/PUT /api/marketplace/pack-order` (§9.2).
- Resolution of a same-name conflict is therefore deterministic from the ordered list alone — no per-conflict override pass exists in MVP. The UI's only conflict-resolution affordance is **reorder** (drag market packs). Customizing (writing into the user pack, which sits above market packs — §3.2) is the other way a user can force a winner.
- **Per-conflict pinning (`pack_conflicts`) is explicitly DEFERRED** (see §11 Deferred). It is NOT in the MVP schema, resolver, API, UI, or tests. The `PackResolver` performs no pin post-pass. The deferred section sketches the future schema so it is additive.

---

## 4. Same-name conflict handling

A **conflict** exists for `(type, name)` whenever `resolve(type)` returns a `ResolvedEntity` with non-empty `shadows[]`.

- The marketplace manager renders a **warning icon** next to any installed pack that participates in a conflict (it either shadows, or is shadowed by, another pack). Hover/expand shows: entity type + name, winner pack, shadowed pack(s).
- The config pages (Roles/Tools/Skills) already show `origin`/`overrides` badges; the same data drives a conflict affordance there (the `overrides` badge already communicates a shadow).
- Resolution mechanism (MVP): the user adjusts `pack_order` (drag-reorder market packs within a scope), or customizes the entity (writes into the scope's user pack, which sits above market packs — §3.2). After either, re-resolve and the warning clears or moves. Per-conflict pinning is deferred (§11).
- A new endpoint `GET /api/packs/conflicts?projectId=` returns the conflict list for the UI (§9).

> Builtin-vs-user "conflicts" are NOT flagged as warnings — that's the normal customize/override flow (a user pack intentionally shadowing builtin). Only **market-pack-involved** shadows raise the warning icon, to avoid noise on every customized role.

---

## 5. Builtin & user-pack mechanics

### 5.1 Builtin pack

- The shipped `dist/server/defaults/` tree becomes the read-only builtin `PackEntry`:
  ```ts
  { id: "builtin", kind: "builtin", scope: "builtin", readOnly: true,
    path: <BuiltinConfigProvider.builtinsDir>, layout: "defaults-tree",
    manifest: { name: "builtin", description: "Bobbit built-ins", version: <app version>, contents: {...} } }
  ```
- `BuiltinConfigProvider` is retained as the *reader* the `RoleLoader`/`ToolLoader` delegate to for this entry (or its parse helpers are extracted; either way the byte-identical parse logic is reused). Builtin skills (`defaults/skills/`) load via `SkillLoader` with `layout: "defaults-tree"`.

### 5.2 User packs

- Each scope's user pack is its `userPackRoot` (§1.3.1): project `<project>/.bobbit/config/`, server `<server-cwd>/.bobbit/config/`, global-user `~/.bobbit/config/` (NEW for roles/tools — §3.1 note; harmless because nothing reads it today).
- **Create/customize** = write the entity file into the scope's user-pack dir (exactly what `RoleStore.put` / `ToolManager` / the `customize` endpoints do today). **Revert** = delete it (`RoleStore.remove` / the `override` DELETE endpoints). No new file operations — the customize/override endpoints keep their current bodies (see `server.ts` `/api/roles/:name/customize` and `/override`).
- **Origin wire contract (LOCKED — option (b)).** The `ConfigOrigin` enum gains a `user` value. The API maps `ResolvedEntity.origin.scope` → wire `origin`, and the topmost shadowed scope → `overrides`:

  | `origin.scope` (winner) | wire `origin` |
  |---|---|
  | `builtin` | `builtin` |
  | `server` | `server` |
  | `global-user` | `user` |
  | `project` | `project` |

  > `config-scope.ts::ConfigOrigin` is extended to `"builtin" | "server" | "user" | "project"` with a matching badge class. This is a small additive UI change (config pages render badges generically). A test pins the mapping (§12). Because global-user is empty for roles/tools today, no *existing* response value changes — `user` only ever appears for newly-installed global-user packs.
- **Pack-origin tagging (acceptance: entities tagged with the *specific pack*).** Beyond the scope badge, `/api/roles|tools|skills` responses carry, for market-pack-originated entities, `originPackId` (`PackEntry.id`, e.g. `market:project:research-pack`) and `originPackName` (the pack's `name`). For builtin/user-pack entities these are `null`. The config pages render `originPackName` as a chip/tooltip next to the scope badge so an installed entity is visibly and contractually tied to its pack (not just its scope). Pinned by an E2E assertion (§12.3 #4).

## 6. THE CRUX — legacy → unified-list mapping

This section defines exactly how today's two installable-type resolvers collapse into the single ordered list while preserving **byte-identical resolution**. `mcp-manager.ts` and `system-prompt.ts` are **NOT** part of this mapping.

### 6.1 Roles & tools (from `ConfigCascade`)

Today `ConfigCascade.resolve<T>` merges three layers by name: builtins → server stores → project store, tagging `origin` and `overrides`. Map to list entries (low→high):

| Order | PackEntry | path | layout | readOnly |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `builtin` | `dist/server/defaults/` | defaults-tree | yes |
| 2 | `user:server` | `<server-cwd>/.bobbit/config/` | defaults-tree | no |
| 3 | `user:global-user` | `~/.bobbit/` | defaults-tree | no *(empty today)* |
| 4 | `user:project` | `<project>/.bobbit/config/` | defaults-tree | no |

- Resolution is identical because: builtin lowest, server next, project highest — exactly the cascade's three layers. The new global-user entry (3) is **empty today** for roles/tools (no code writes there), so it cannot change current output.
- Market packs (when present) interleave **within** each scope segment, user-pack-below-market (§3.2). With zero market packs installed (the only state the existing tests exercise), the list is exactly the four rows above ⇒ identical merge ⇒ `config-cascade.test.ts` passes unchanged.
- `origin`/`overrides`: derive from `origin.scope` + top of `shadows[]` per §5.2 mapping. For the existing builtin/server/project cases this yields exactly today's values, so `config-cascade-api.spec.ts` and `config-scope.spec.ts` pass.

### 6.2 Skills (from `slash-skills.ts`)

Today `discoverSlashSkills` merges, lowest→highest:

```
BUILTIN_SKILLS (the in-code "compact" entry)
→ builtin-file (defaults/skills/)
→ custom (config_directories skills entries)
→ legacy (.claude/commands/)
→ bobbit personal (~/.bobbit/skills)
→ claude personal (~/.claude/skills)
→ bobbit project (.bobbit/skills)
→ claude project (.claude/skills)
```

Map to PackEntries (low→high) — **the order above is preserved exactly**:

| Order | PackEntry id | path | layout | scope | onlyTypes | readOnly |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `builtin-skills-static` | (in-code) | — | builtin | skills | yes |
| 2 | `builtin` (skills) | `dist/server/defaults/skills` | defaults-tree* | builtin | skills | yes |
| 3 | `legacy:custom:<path>` (per `config_directories` skills entry) | user dir | skills-flat | (by location) | skills | yes |
| 4 | `legacy:.claude/commands` | `<cwd>/.claude/commands` | commands-flat | project | skills | yes |
| 5 | `legacy:~/.bobbit/skills` | `~/.bobbit/skills` | skills-flat | global-user | skills | yes |
| 6 | `legacy:~/.claude/skills` | `~/.claude/skills` | skills-flat | global-user | skills | yes |
| 7 | `legacy:.bobbit/skills` | `<cwd>/.bobbit/skills` | skills-flat | project | skills | yes |
| 8 | `legacy:.claude/skills` | `<cwd>/.claude/skills` | skills-flat | project | skills | yes |

\* The builtin pack's own `skills/` subtree is loaded via the shared builtin entry (row 2 in §6.1) restricted to skills; listed separately here for clarity of order.

Critical correctness notes:
- **`onlyTypes: ["skills"]`** on every legacy-implicit entry means the role/tool loaders never run on them — they only ever contributed skills, and that must not change.
- **Claude-compatible dirs stay where they are.** `.claude/skills`, `~/.claude/skills`, `.bobbit/skills`, `~/.bobbit/skills`, `.claude/commands` are *referenced* as `readOnly` legacy-implicit packs, **never moved or copied**. Cross-tool compatibility (Claude Code reading the same files) is preserved.
- The relative order of these 8 entries is **identical** to today's insertion order in `discoverSlashSkills`, so `Map`-overwrite precedence is byte-identical ⇒ `skill-resolve.test.ts`, `validate-skill-discovery.test.ts`, `skill-manifest.test.ts`, `slash-skill-e2e.spec.ts` pass.
- The TTL cache, `userInvocable` filtering, and alphabetical sort in `discoverSlashSkills` move into the skills adapter (§6.4), unchanged.

### 6.3 `disabled_config_directories`

**Status of `disabled_config_directories` today (verified in source):** it is only *written* (`removeBuiltinDirectory`) and *cleared* (`resetConfigDirectories`); **no resolution code path reads it to omit a directory.** `discoverSlashSkills`, `getSkillDirectories`, and `getAllConfigDirectories` do **not** filter by it — so disabling a built-in skill dir today is an **inert no-op for resolution** (the dir still resolves). The goal spec's worked example #3 ("`slash-skills.ts` skips it") describes *intended* behavior, not current behavior.

**Decision (explicit — NOT framed as byte-identical):** the unified resolver **honors** `disabled_config_directories` — a matching legacy-implicit `PackEntry` is **omitted** from the ordered list before resolution (path comparison via the same `expandPath`/`path.resolve` normalization). This is a **deliberate, documented fix** of a currently-inert setting, scoped to skills' legacy dirs.

- **Why this does not break the byte-identical invariant:** that invariant covers all *currently-resolved* inputs. No existing test pins "a disabled dir still resolves" (it can't — disablement was inert and the dir resolved regardless). The only behavior that changes is the previously-impossible case where a dir is *both* disabled *and* present — not exercised by any existing test — so `skill-resolve.test.ts` / `validate-skill-discovery.test.ts` / `per-project-config-dirs.spec.ts` continue to pass unchanged.
- **New coverage required:** add a unit test asserting a disabled skill dir is now omitted from resolution (unit #6), and a compatibility note in the changelog/docs. The acceptance/tests do **not** claim byte-identical for this case — they claim "deliberate enforcement, newly tested."

### 6.4 Refactor of `slash-skills.ts`

- `discoverSlashSkills(cwd, projectConfigStore)` is reimplemented as a thin adapter:
  1. Build the skills segment of the ordered list (rows 1–8 above + any market packs' `skills/`) via a shared `buildPackList(cwd, store, scope)` (§6.5).
  2. `packResolver.resolve<SlashSkill>("skills")`.
  3. Apply `userInvocable !== false` filter + alphabetical sort + TTL cache (unchanged).
  4. Return `SlashSkill[]` — the `source` field is derived from `origin.kind`/`origin.id` to keep the existing `"project"|"personal"|"legacy"|"built-in"|"custom"` values for API/UI back-compat.
- `getSkillDirectories(cwd, store)` returns the same shape as today, now computed from the list entries (so `/api/skills` `directories` payload is unchanged).
- **No skills code path scans directories independently of the resolver afterward.**

### 6.5 Building the unified list (single entry point)

```ts
/** Build the one ordered list for a given resolution context, low→high priority. */
export function buildPackList(opts: {
  builtinsDir: string;              // dist/server/defaults
  // Per-scope roots derived via scopePaths() (§1.3.1). Each yields
  // { userPackRoot=<base>/.bobbit/config, marketPacksRoot=<base>/.bobbit/config/market-packs }.
  serverBase: string;               // <server-cwd>
  globalUserBase: string;           // os.homedir()
  projectBase?: string;             // <project root>  (omitted in system scope)
  cwd: string;                      // project rootPath (for legacy .claude/*, .bobbit/* skill dirs)
  serverConfigStore: ProjectConfigReader;   // reads pack_order.{server,global-user} + legacy keys
  projectConfigStore?: ProjectConfigReader; // reads pack_order.project + legacy keys (project scope)
}): PackEntry[];
```

Steps (low→high):
1. Push `builtin` (`builtinsDir`).
2. For each scope in `[server, global-user, project]` (in that order), using `scopePaths(scope, base)`:
   a. push the scope's `market-packs/*` entries — each `<marketPacksRoot>/*` dir that has **both** a valid `pack.yaml` and a valid `.pack-meta.yaml` (§8.1 corrupt-guard; `.tmp-*` skipped) — ordered by that scope's `pack_order[scope]`.
   b. push the scope's user-pack entry (`userPackRoot`).
   c. push the scope's legacy-implicit skill entries (rows from §6.2 that belong to this scope).
3. Apply within-scope ordering rules (§3.2): market packs lowest, then user pack, then legacy skill entries — reproducing §6.2's exact order for skills.
4. Remove any entry whose path is in `disabled_config_directories` (§6.3, deliberate enforcement).
5. Read `config_directories` (legacy key, via `parseCustomDirectories`) and insert skills entries as `legacy:custom:<path>` at the position from §6.2 row 3.

> **Back-compat invariant:** the legacy keys `config_directories`, `skill_directories`, `disabled_config_directories` keep being **read** (via the existing `config-directories.ts` helpers) **only** to construct this list. After construction, no roles/tools/skills code path scans dirs on its own.

### 6.6 Worked examples (must resolve identically)

**1. Project override of a builtin role.**
- Today: builtin `coder` at `dist/server/defaults/roles/coder.yaml`; project override at `<project>/.bobbit/config/roles/coder.yaml`; cascade → project wins, `origin=project, overrides=builtin`.
- Unified: list = `[builtin, …, user:project]`. Resolver: builtin loads `coder`, `user:project` loads `coder` and shadows it. `origin.scope=project`, `shadows=[builtin]` ⇒ badge `origin=project, overrides=builtin`. Revert = delete project user-pack file. ✅ identical.

**2. User-registered custom skills directory (`config_directories`).**
- Today: `config_directories: [{ path: "~/dev/my-skills", types: ["skills"] }]`; `slash-skills.ts` scans it at the `custom` precedence slot.
- Unified: on `buildPackList`, that entry → `legacy:custom:/home/u/dev/my-skills`, `layout: skills-flat`, `onlyTypes:["skills"]`, inserted at §6.2 row 3. Its `SKILL.md`s load via `SkillLoader`. Same skills, same precedence (above builtin-file, below legacy/personal/project). ✅ identical.

**3. Disabled built-in scan location.** *(Deliberate behavior fix — see §6.3; not byte-identical.)*
- Today: `disabled_config_directories` contains `<project>/.claude/skills`. This is currently **inert for resolution** — the dir's skills still resolve (no code reads the disable list to omit it).
- Unified: the `legacy:.claude/skills` entry is omitted from the list (§6.3) ⇒ nothing from it resolves. This **matches the goal spec's intended behavior** and is the one place the reframe deliberately changes (previously-inert) behavior, covered by new unit test #6. All currently-pinned skill resolution is unchanged.

**4. Claude-compatible personal skills (`~/.claude/skills`, `~/.bobbit/skills`).**
- Today: scanned at personal scope by `slash-skills.ts`.
- Unified: pre-registered as `legacy:~/.claude/skills` / `legacy:~/.bobbit/skills` at the global-user position; still discovered; files stay in place (referenced, not moved) so Claude Code still sees them. MCP's own Claude-compatible locations are untouched (still read by `mcp-manager.ts`). ✅ identical.

## 7. Source registry

### 7.1 Persistence

Marketplace **source URLs** are a small registry. Sources are **global** to the server (not per-project): a registered source can be browsed and installed into any scope. Persist in a new store file:

```
<server-cwd>/.bobbit/config/marketplace-sources.yaml
```

```yaml
# marketplace-sources.yaml
sources:
  - id: acme                       # stable id ([a-z0-9-]+), unique
    url: https://github.com/acme/bobbit-packs.git   # git URL OR absolute local dir path
    ref: main                      # branch/tag (default: remote HEAD)
    addedAt: 2026-06-03T10:00:00Z
    lastSyncedAt: 2026-06-03T10:05:00Z
    lastCommit: 9f3c1a8
```

```ts
export interface MarketplaceSource {
  id: string;
  url: string;          // git remote URL or absolute local directory
  ref?: string;
  addedAt: string;
  lastSyncedAt?: string;
  lastCommit?: string;
}
export class MarketplaceSourceStore { /* CRUD + load/save YAML, mirrors RoleStore patterns */ }
```

### 7.2 Git sync

- A source is synced into a server-local cache before browse/install:
  ```
  <server-cwd>/.bobbit/state/marketplace-cache/<source-id>/
  ```
- **Local-dir sources** (`url` is an absolute path): no clone; read directly. `commit` recorded as empty.
- **Git sources:** **shallow clone** (`git clone --depth 1 --branch <ref> <url> <cache-dir>`); re-sync via `git fetch --depth 1 && git reset --hard origin/<ref>` (or re-clone if the cache is dirty/missing). Resolve and record `lastCommit` via `git rev-parse HEAD`.
- **Private repos:** rely on the user's ambient git credentials (credential helper / SSH agent) exactly as Bobbit's worktree/clone code does today. No credential storage in the marketplace.
- Sync is invoked on: add-source, explicit "re-sync", and implicitly before browse if the cache is missing. Surface git errors to the UI verbatim.

### 7.3 Browsing

`browsePacks(sourceId)`: sync (if needed) → scan the cache root one level deep → for each subdir with a `pack.yaml`, parse the manifest → return `PackManifest[] + dirName`. Directories without `pack.yaml` ignored.

---

## 8. Install / uninstall / update file operations

All operations are plain directory copies/deletes (no per-entity bookkeeping).

### 8.1 Install

`installPack(sourceId, packName, scope)` — **atomic**: build a complete staged dir, then a single rename publishes it.
1. Sync source cache (§7.2).
2. Resolve `src = <cache>/<packName>` (must contain a valid `pack.yaml` — else 422).
3. Resolve `dest = <marketPacksRoot>/<packName>` where `marketPacksRoot = scopePaths(scope, base).marketPacksRoot` (§1.3.1) — i.e. `<base>/.bobbit/config/market-packs` with `base` = `~` | `<server-cwd>` | `<project root>`. Same derivation `buildPackList` uses, so install and resolution never diverge. Reject unsafe `packName` (path-traversal guard) before any fs op.
4. Reject if `dest` already exists (require explicit update/uninstall) → 409.
5. **Copy `src` → a staging dir** `<marketPacksRoot>/.tmp-<packName>-<rand>` verbatim (entire subtree: `pack.yaml`, `roles/`, `tools/` incl. `extension.ts` + `_shared`, `skills/`). Skip `.git`.
6. Write `<staging>/.pack-meta.yaml` (§1.5) with `sourceUrl`, `sourceRef`, resolved `commit`, `version` from manifest, `installedAt = updatedAt = now`, `scope`.
7. **Atomically rename** staging → `dest` (`fs.rename`). Only after the meta is written does the pack become visible at its final path. On any failure before the rename, `fs.rm` the staging dir and surface the error — `dest` never half-exists.
8. Append `packName` to that scope's `pack_order`.
9. Trigger a resolver reload for the affected scope so entities appear immediately.

> **Partial-install / corruption guard.** The resolver treats a `market-packs/<name>/` dir as an installed market pack **only if** it contains BOTH a valid `pack.yaml` and a valid `.pack-meta.yaml`. A dir missing/with-invalid `.pack-meta.yaml` (e.g. a crash mid-copy, or a stray `.tmp-*` staging dir) is **ignored for resolution** and reported as `corrupt` in `GET /api/marketplace/installed` so the UI can offer re-install/cleanup. `.tmp-*` staging dirs are never scanned as packs.

### 8.2 Uninstall

`uninstallPack(scope, packName)`:
1. `dest = scopePaths(scope, base).marketPacksRoot + "/" + packName` (§1.3.1).
2. **`fs.rm(dest, { recursive: true })`** — deletes exactly what install added.
3. Remove `packName` from that scope's `pack_order`.
4. Reload resolver. Uninstalling removes precisely the installed entities (no orphan ledger to reconcile).

### 8.3 Update

`updatePack(scope, packName)`:
1. Read `dest/.pack-meta.yaml` for `sourceUrl`/`sourceRef`.
2. Re-sync the source cache; re-resolve `commit`.
3. **Replace** `dest` atomically: copy the fresh `src` subtree into a `.tmp-*` staging dir, write the updated `.pack-meta.yaml` into staging, then swap (rename old `dest` aside → rename staging → `dest` → `fs.rm` the old). Preserve nothing stale; on failure the original `dest` is left intact.
4. Updated `.pack-meta.yaml` carries new `commit`/`version` and `updatedAt = now` (keep original `installedAt`, copied from the old meta).
5. Reload resolver. Re-syncing + re-installing reflects upstream changes.

> Implement copy via a shared recursive copy helper (reuse/extend whatever `continue-archived.ts`'s copy utilities or a `fs.cp(src, dest, {recursive:true})` wrapper provides). Guard all destination paths with `isSafeRelPath`-style checks against `..`/absolute/UNC.

---

## 9. REST API surface

New endpoints (added in `server.ts::handleApiRoute`). Responses reuse existing config-page conventions where overlapping.

| Method & path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/marketplace/sources` | List registered sources (`MarketplaceSource[]`). |
| `POST /api/marketplace/sources` | Add a source `{ url, ref? }` → syncs + returns the created source. |
| `DELETE /api/marketplace/sources/:id` | Remove a source (and its cache dir). |
| `POST /api/marketplace/sources/:id/sync` | Re-sync (re-clone/fetch); returns updated `lastCommit`. |
| `GET /api/marketplace/sources/:id/packs` | Browse: `{ packs: Array<PackManifest & { dirName, hasTools, descriptions? }> }`. `hasTools` is informational (declared-entity rendering); it no longer drives a per-pack install gate. `descriptions?` carries optional one-line per-entity copy (§9.1/§10.4 R3). |
| `POST /api/marketplace/install` | Body `{ sourceId, packName, scope, projectId? }` → installs; returns `.pack-meta.yaml`. |
| `POST /api/marketplace/update` | Body `{ scope, packName, projectId? }` → updates; returns new meta. |
| `DELETE /api/marketplace/installed` | Body `{ scope, packName, projectId? }` → uninstall. |
| `GET /api/marketplace/installed?projectId=` | List installed packs across all scopes with provenance (`PackMeta` + manifest + scope), plus `updateAvailable` + `sourceStatus` (sync-free update gating) per row (§9.1/§10.4 R2). |
| `GET /api/packs/conflicts?projectId=` | List `(type, name, winner, shadowed[])` conflicts for the resolved list. |

- `scope` ∈ `"global-user" | "server" | "project"`; `projectId` required when `scope === "project"`.
| `GET /api/marketplace/pack-order?scope=&projectId=` | — → read a scope's market-pack order (§9.2). |
| `PUT /api/marketplace/pack-order` | Body `{ scope, projectId?, order: string[] }` → replace a scope's order (§9.2). |

- Existing endpoints unchanged in shape: `/api/roles`, `/api/tools`, `/api/skills` keep returning `origin`/`overrides` — now sourced from `PackResolver` instead of `ConfigCascade`/`discoverSlashSkills` (§6). The `origin` field gains the locked `user` value (§5.2, option (b)) and entities carry `originPackId`/`originPackName` (null for builtin/user).
- `/api/config-directories` (GET/DELETE/reset) is retained for back-compat (it still reports the legacy dirs + disablement), now reflecting the unified list's legacy entries. Its tests (`per-project-config-dirs.spec.ts`) must still pass.

### 9.1 Request/response contracts

All responses are JSON. `scope` values use the wire form `"global-user" | "server" | "project"`. **Installed-pack addressing** is the tuple `(scope, packName)` — there is no separate install id; `packName` is unique within a scope's `market-packs/`.

```ts
// Shared wire types
interface SourceWire { id: string; url: string; ref?: string; addedAt: string;
                       lastSyncedAt?: string; lastCommit?: string; }
// One-line, per-entity descriptions sourced from the pack DIR (not the runtime
// APIs), keyed by the same identity the toggles/chips use: roles/skills by name,
// tools by GROUP name, entrypoints by `listName`. Best-effort — a kind is
// omitted when no entity in it has a usable description, an entity is omitted
// when its description is missing/empty. Carried on BOTH wire shapes so the
// "Show details" disclosure works for installed AND not-yet-installed packs.
interface PackEntityDescriptions {
  roles?:       Record<string, string>;
  tools?:       Record<string, string>;
  skills?:      Record<string, string>;
  entrypoints?: Record<string, string>;
}
interface BrowsePackWire extends PackManifest {
  dirName: string;
  hasTools: boolean;
  descriptions?: PackEntityDescriptions;   // §10.4 R3
}
interface InstalledPackWire {
  scope: "global-user" | "server" | "project";
  packName: string;
  manifest: PackManifest;          // from pack.yaml
  meta: PackMeta;                  // from .pack-meta.yaml
  status: "ok" | "corrupt";        // corrupt = missing/invalid meta (§8.1 guard)
  // §10.4 R2 — update gating, computed WITHOUT a network sync (reads the
  // existing local cache only; see `MarketplaceInstaller.listInstalled`).
  updateAvailable: boolean;        // true iff source's latest manifest version
                                   //   differs from installed meta.version AND
                                   //   the source could be checked.
  sourceStatus: "ok" | "unknown";  // "unknown" = source removed / never-synced /
                                   //   no version data ⇒ render "Source not found".
}
interface ConflictWire {
  type: "roles" | "tools" | "skills";
  name: string;
  winner:   { packEntryId: string; scope: string; label: string };
  shadowed: { packEntryId: string; scope: string; label: string }[];
}
```

| Endpoint | Request body | Success | Errors |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/marketplace/sources` | — | `200 { sources: SourceWire[] }` | — |
| `POST /api/marketplace/sources` | `{ url: string, ref?: string }` | `201 { source: SourceWire }` (sync runs; `lastCommit` populated) | `400` missing/invalid url; `409` duplicate url; `502 { error }` git sync failed (verbatim git stderr) |
| `DELETE /api/marketplace/sources/:id` | — | `204` (also removes cache dir) | `404` unknown id |
| `POST /api/marketplace/sources/:id/sync` | — | `200 { source: SourceWire }` | `404` unknown id; `502 { error }` git failure |
| `GET /api/marketplace/sources/:id/packs` | — | `200 { packs: BrowsePackWire[] }` (dirs without valid `pack.yaml` omitted) | `404` unknown id; `502` sync failure |
| `POST /api/marketplace/install` | `{ sourceId, packName, scope, projectId? }` | `201 { installed: InstalledPackWire }` | `400` bad scope / missing `projectId` for project scope / unsafe `packName`; `404` unknown source or pack; `409` already installed at that scope; `422` invalid `pack.yaml` (or `contents.mcp` present); `502` sync failure |
| `POST /api/marketplace/update` | `{ scope, packName, projectId? }` | `200 { installed: InstalledPackWire }` | `400`/`404` as above; `409` not installed; `502` sync failure |
| `DELETE /api/marketplace/installed` | `{ scope, packName, projectId? }` | `204` | `400` bad scope/missing projectId; `404` not installed |
| `GET /api/marketplace/installed?projectId=` | — | `200 { installed: InstalledPackWire[] }` (all scopes; `corrupt` entries included) | `400` project scope requested without projectId |
| `GET /api/packs/conflicts?projectId=` | — | `200 { conflicts: ConflictWire[] }` | `400` as above |

- **No per-pack install gate.** Trust is handled once at the source-add boundary via a blanket warning + "Why?" disclosure (§10.2); the client POSTs `install` directly with no executable-code confirmation. The server never required a confirmation flag, and install of any pack is unrestricted. `hasTools` in the browse payload is now informational only.
- **Reload/cache behavior:** install/update/uninstall invalidate the affected scope's resolver cache (and the `slash-skills.ts` TTL cache) synchronously before returning, so a subsequent `GET /api/roles|tools|skills` reflects the change immediately (no client reload required). `pack_order` mutations do the same.
- **Update detection is sync-free (§10.4 R2).** `GET /api/marketplace/installed` enriches each row with `updateAvailable` + `sourceStatus`, but **never triggers a `git fetch`** — it reads only the *existing* local source cache (a git source's already-cloned cache dir, or a local-dir source read in place). The list endpoint is hit on every Market-page open, so a network sync per pack would be slow and could fail offline; the cheap local-cache read is good enough because explicit "Re-sync" / Update already refresh the cache when the user wants live data. A miss (source unregistered, never synced, cache absent, pack not found, or no source version) yields `sourceStatus: "unknown"` rather than a false "up to date", letting the UI disambiguate the two.
- **Browse descriptions:** `GET /api/marketplace/sources/:id/packs` adds an optional `descriptions` map per pack (§10.4 R3), read from the synced source's pack dir.
- **Idempotency / concurrency:** install is rejected (`409`) if `dest` exists; the atomic-rename (§8.1) makes concurrent installs of the same `(scope, packName)` safe — the loser sees `EEXIST`/`409`.

### 9.2 `pack-order` contract (the sole conflict-resolution wire path)

```ts
// GET /api/marketplace/pack-order?scope=project&projectId=p1
// 200 → { scope, order: string[] }   // order = current pack_order[scope], highest LAST
// PUT /api/marketplace/pack-order
// body: { scope: "global-user"|"server"|"project", projectId?: string, order: string[] }
// 200 → { scope, order: string[] }   // normalized: unknown names dropped, on-disk-but-absent appended lowest
```

- **Routing of persistence:** `project` reads/writes `pack_order.project` in `<project>/.bobbit/config/project.yaml`; `server` / `global-user` read/write `pack_order.server` / `pack_order["global-user"]` in the **server** config store (§3.3). The handler picks the store from `scope`.
- **Errors:** `400` unknown scope, missing `projectId` for `scope=project`, or `order` not a string array; `404` project not found. Names in `order` that aren't installed at that scope are **dropped** (not an error) and the normalized result is returned.
- **Cache invalidation:** a successful `PUT` invalidates the affected scope's resolver cache + the `slash-skills.ts` TTL cache synchronously, so the next `GET /api/roles|tools|skills` and `/api/packs/conflicts` reflect the new order. This is the mechanism the marketplace UI's drag-reorder calls; covered by E2E #9.
- The drag-reorder UI mirrors the existing project drag-reorder component; reordering is the only conflict-resolution affordance in MVP (no pin).

## 10. UI

### 10.1 Market button (sidebar)

Add a **Market** button in the config-nav row, **between Workflows and New Goal**, in `src/app/sidebar.ts` (the `<div class="flex items-center">` block that currently holds Workflows then New Goal — see lines ~1382–1404). Follow the exact pattern of the Workflows button:

```ts
import { ShoppingBag /* or Store */ } from "lucide";
// ...
<button
  class="flex-1 flex items-center justify-center gap-1 px-1 py-1 whitespace-nowrap ${isMarketActive ? 'text-primary bg-primary/10 font-medium' : 'text-muted-foreground hover:text-foreground hover:bg-secondary/50'} rounded-md transition-colors"
  @click=${() => toggleConfigPage(["market"], () => {
    import("./marketplace-page.js").then((m) => m.loadMarketplaceData());
    import("./routing.js").then((m) => m.setHashRoute("market"));
  })}
  title="Marketplace"
>${icon(ShoppingBag, "xs", "!w-3.5 !h-3.5")}<span>Market</span></button>
```

- Register the `market` route in `routing.ts` (mirror `workflows`) and add `isMarketActive = isRouteActive("market")`.
- The Workflows and New Goal buttons currently share one flex row; insert Market between them (it becomes a 3-button row, or restructure to keep alignment — match the existing two-row grouping visually).

### 10.2 Marketplace page (`src/app/marketplace-page.js`)

Reuse config-page conventions (`config-scope.ts`: `renderConfigScopeRow`, `renderOriginBadge`, scope state):

- **Sources panel:** list registered sources; "Add source" (URL + optional ref); per-source "Re-sync" and "Remove". The Add-source controls carry a persistent **blanket trust warning** (only add sources you trust — installing any pack can run code or instruct agents on your machine) plus an expandable, keyboard-accessible **"Why?"** disclosure (collapsed by default) explaining the per-entity-type risk spectrum: **Tools** ship `extension.ts` / `_shared/` code that runs directly in the Bobbit server process on the host with no LLM/sandbox in the loop (highest risk); **Skills** are free-form instructions an agent follows literally (agent has shell access); **Roles** steer persona/behavior (more diffuse, but still drive an LLM with tool access). Trust is decided here, once, at the source boundary.
- **Browse panel:** select a source → list its packs (name, version, description, declared entities as chips). Each pack has an **Install** button with a **scope picker** (System/server, Global-user, or a project — reuse `renderConfigScopeRow` semantics).
- **Installed panel:** list installed packs grouped by scope with provenance (source URL, version, commit short SHA, install/updated dates from `.pack-meta.yaml`); per-pack **Update** and **Uninstall**.
- **Conflict warnings:** packs participating in a same-name conflict show a warning icon (from `GET /api/packs/conflicts`); expand to see entity/type/winner/shadowed; the only resolution affordance is **reorder** (adjust `pack_order` via drag) — no per-conflict pin in MVP.
- After install/uninstall/update, refresh the Roles/Tools/Skills page data so installed entities appear with the pack as `origin` and the existing badge styling.

### 10.3 Config-page integration

Roles (`#/roles`), Tools (`#/tools`), Skills (`#/skills`) pages need no structural change — they already render `origin`/`overrides` badges and scope rows. They will now show market-pack-originated entities with the pack as origin (badge value per §5.2). Optionally show the pack name in a tooltip on the badge.

### 10.4 Marketplace UI polish

A follow-up pass (`goal/marketplace-ui-b94dadf1`) tightened the Market surface for readability and to surface install/update state honestly. Theme tokens only — no hardcoded palette, no `:root` overrides (see the `marketplace.css` header). All affordances preserve the existing data-testids and add new ones for the new controls. The four requirement areas (R1–R4):

**R1 — Standalone activation help removed.** The explanatory paragraph that used to render below the activation toggles (`.market-activation-help`) was deleted. *Why:* the toggles are self-explanatory once the per-entity descriptions (R3) are available; the paragraph was noise that competed with the pack provenance and action buttons for vertical space.

**R2 — Update button gating + "Source not found" lozenge.** `renderInstalledPackCard()` previously always rendered an **Update** button. It is now gated on `updateAvailable`:
- `updateAvailable: true` → render **Update** (`data-testid="market-update-pack"`).
- else `sourceStatus: "unknown"` → render a muted/warning **"Source not found"** lozenge (`data-testid="market-source-unknown"`) in place of Update, with a tooltip explaining the source is unregistered or unsynced so updates can't be checked.
- else (up to date, source ok) → render neither.
- **Uninstall stays always available** regardless of source state — a user must always be able to remove an installed pack even if its source is gone.

  *Why the `updateAvailable` / `sourceStatus` split:* a single boolean can't distinguish "confirmed up to date" from "we couldn't check". Showing nothing in the unknown case would imply the pack is current; showing a stale Update button would be misleading. The two-field contract (§9.1) lets the UI render the honest third state. **Change detection is version-based:** the source's latest **manifest version** is compared (string inequality) against the installed `meta.version` — not commit SHAs or file diffs — which is cheap, deterministic, and matches the semver the publisher advertises. Computed server-side in `MarketplaceInstaller.listInstalled()` via `computeSourceState()`, reading the local cache only (no `git fetch`; see §9.1).

**R3 — Per-entity one-line descriptions in a collapsed disclosure.** Each declared role / tool / skill / entry point can now show a one-line description, sourced from the pack dir by `readPackEntityDescriptions()`:
- Roles: `roles/<name>.yaml` `description` (falling back to `label` when it differs from the name).
- Tools: a representative `tools/<group>/*.yaml` `description` (keyed by **group** name — the manifest declares tools at group granularity).
- Skills: `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` frontmatter `description`.
- Entry points: the entrypoint YAML `description` (falling back to its `label`), keyed by `listName`.

Descriptions are carried on **both** `PackActivationCatalogue` (Installed list) and `BrowsePackWire` (Browse card) and rendered identically by a shared `renderEntityDetails()` helper inside a `<details>` disclosure labelled **"Show details"** (`data-testid="market-entity-details-<packName>"`), **collapsed by default**. *Why collapsed:* the entity-name chips and toggles stay the at-a-glance default; descriptions are progressive disclosure for users who want detail, so a pack with many entities doesn't produce a wall of text. Rows with no description are omitted; the disclosure is omitted entirely when no row would render (graceful degradation).

This is read from the **same authoritative pack dir** the activation catalogue reads from — never `/api/tools` or `/api/ext/contributions` — preserving the invariant that the catalogue is the UNFILTERED source for toggles (§9, pack-schema-v1 §9). **Path-traversal safety:** `validateManifest` does not guard `contents.roles/tools/skills` names against `..` or path separators, and this helper runs on **Browse** (before any install), so every manifest-declared name is validated with `isSafeBasename` + a realpath-aware containment check (`isPackPathWithinRoot`) before any filesystem read. A rejected name simply yields no description row.

**R4 — Browse install-state indicators.** `renderBrowsePackCard()` now cross-references the installed list to reflect what's already installed *at the currently-selected install scope* (including project identity — see finding #2):
- not installed → **Install** button (`data-testid="market-install-pack"`, unchanged).
- installed but behind the source's latest (same version comparison as R2) → **Update** button.
- installed and current → an **"Installed"** lozenge (`data-testid="market-browse-installed"`).

`installedMatchForBrowse()` resolves the match by pack name within the selected scope; for project scope it only matches when the Installed list was loaded for that same project, avoiding a wrong-project false positive. *Why:* without this, Browse always offered "Install" even for packs already present, leading to confusing `409 already installed` errors; surfacing state up front guides the user to the correct action.

**Scope/project-focus discipline (finding #2, unchanged):** install/update/uninstall and the Installed-list query all address the **same project** the install targeted (`focusProjectId`), so the indicators and actions never drift to the active/first project.

## 11. Extensibility seams

The design is additive along three axes:
- **Entity-type set:** add an `EntityLoader<T>` and register it; the pipeline (`PackResolver`) is type-agnostic. `mcp/` and `panels/` slot in here. `mcp` is reserved only as a code-level `EntityType` for the future loader — it is **not** a publishable `PackManifest.contents` key in MVP (a manifest declaring `contents.mcp` is rejected, §1.4).
- **Pack/source format:** `pack.yaml`/`.pack-meta.yaml` parsers ignore unknown keys; new layouts add a `PackEntry.layout` variant + loader support.
- **Install pipeline:** `installPack`/`updatePack` are source-backend-agnostic (git or local dir today); a hosted-registry backend implements the same sync→copy contract.

**Future UI-panel/plugin bundle (the headline future use case):** a panel pack would ship a `panels/<name>/` subtree (manifest + entry HTML/JS + a panel descriptor). The seam: (a) a `PanelLoader` plugged into the resolver, (b) `PackManifest.contents.panels`, (c) a panel host that mounts resolved panels (PR-Walkthrough generalised). Nothing is built now, but the resolver and pack format already accommodate it without redesign.

### Deferred (explicit seams left)

- **MCP server installs** — `mcp/` loader seam reserved; `mcp-manager.ts` untouched and still resolves existing `.mcp.json`. Revisit with a parameterization/secrets model. Packs may NOT install `mcp/` in MVP.
- **AGENTS/CLAUDE.md installs** — not installable; `system-prompt.ts::readAllAgentFiles` untouched. Existing AGENTS.md resolution preserved.
- **Portable/parameterised workflow bundles** — workflows stay project-scoped inline in `project.yaml`; note what'd change (decouple from component/command pairs) but build nothing.
- **Staff templates** as exportable packs — gap noted.
- **Trust / sandboxing / signing** of code-bearing packs — MVP copies tool code as-is with a UI warning; sketch where a permission/trust gate slots into `installPack`.
- **Hosted/remote registry with search** — `MarketplaceSource` abstraction kept open to a registry backend.
- **Per-conflict pinning (`pack_conflicts`)** — deferred; MVP resolves same-name conflicts solely via `pack_order` (§3.3) plus user-pack customization (§3.2). The future schema (additive, no migration needed) would be a `pack_conflicts` list in `project.yaml`/server config:
  ```yaml
  pack_conflicts:
    - type: roles
      name: researcher
      winner: market:project:research-pack   # PackEntry.id
  ```
  applied as a post-pass in `PackResolver.resolve` (after the ordered merge, re-point `byName.get(name)` to the pinned entry). Not implemented, surfaced, or tested in MVP.

## 12. Test plan

### 12.1 Existing tests that MUST keep passing (the regression contract)

| Test | Pins | Preserved by |
|---|---|---|
| `tests/config-cascade.test.ts` | role model/thinkingLevel project>server>builtin; `origin`/`overrides` | §6.1 list = builtin<server<project with zero market packs |
| `tests/e2e/config-cascade-api.spec.ts` | `/api/roles` `/api/tools` origin/overrides over HTTP | §6.1 + §5.2 badge mapping |
| `tests/e2e/ui/config-scope.spec.ts` | scope rows, customize/revert UX, badges | §5.2 customize/override endpoints unchanged |
| `tests/config-directories.test.ts` | `parseCustomDirectories`, `getAllConfigDirectories` (13 builtin), `saveCustomDirectories` | legacy helpers retained, only consumed by `buildPackList` |
| `tests/e2e/per-project-config-dirs.spec.ts` | per-project config_directories behaviour | §6.5 step 5 (config_directories still read to build list). NB: disablement was inert for resolution (§6.3) — this suite does not pin "disabled dir still resolves", so the new enforcement (unit #6) doesn't conflict with it. |
| `tests/e2e/tools-cascade.spec.ts` | tool group customize/override cascade | §6.1 tool loader + endpoints |
| `tests/skill-resolve.test.ts` | byte-equal slash expansion + precedence | §6.2 order identical, adapter reuses parse/sort/cache |
| `tests/validate-skill-discovery.test.ts` | skill discovery across dirs | §6.2 + §6.4 |
| `tests/skill-manifest.test.ts` | activation header/manifest | §6.4 (unchanged) |
| `tests/e2e/slash-skill-e2e.spec.ts` | end-to-end slash skills | §6.2 + §6.4 |

> Rule: if any of these fail, fix the mapping, not the test. If a behavior the reframe must preserve isn't currently pinned (e.g. skills disablement via `disabled_config_directories`), **add the test before refactoring**.

### 12.2 New unit tests (file:// fixtures)

Point at fixture pack trees under a tmp dir.

1. **Pack discovery & manifest parsing** — dir with/without `pack.yaml`; valid/invalid/forward-compat `pack.yaml`; `.pack-meta.yaml` round-trip.
2. **PackResolver core** — ordered list low→high; same-name shadow; `shadows[]` accumulation; `onlyTypes` filtering. (No `pack_conflicts` pin — deferred.)
3. **Per-type loaders** — RoleLoader/ToolLoader (`defaults-tree`, grouped+flat tools), SkillLoader (all three layouts).
4. **Three-scope resolution** — builtin/user/market across builtin<server<global-user<project; verify project wins, global-user beats server, **within-scope user pack > market packs** (customize wins locally), and `pack_order` reordering of market-vs-market.
5. **Legacy→unified mapping equivalence** — build the list from fixtures mirroring §6.1/§6.2 and assert resolution **equals** the legacy `ConfigCascade`/`discoverSlashSkills` output for the same inputs (a direct A/B harness, like `skill-resolve.test.ts`'s `legacy()` fixture).
6. **`disabled_config_directories` enforcement (new behavior, §6.3)** — assert a present-AND-disabled skill dir is now **omitted** from resolution (was inert before). Also assert a present-but-not-disabled dir still resolves (guards against over-omission).
7. **File ops** — `installPack` copies subtree + writes meta + appends `pack_order`; `uninstallPack` deletes exactly the added dir + cleans order; `updatePack` replaces contents + rewrites meta (preserves `installedAt`). Path-traversal guards reject unsafe names.
8. **Source store** — `MarketplaceSourceStore` CRUD + YAML persistence; local-dir vs git-url branching (mock git or use a local bare repo fixture).

### 12.3 Browser E2E (mandatory — pattern after `settings.spec.ts` + reuse `config-scope.spec.ts`)

`tests/e2e/ui/marketplace.spec.ts`:
1. **Market button** visible and positioned **between Workflows and New Goal**; opens the marketplace surface.
2. **Register source** (use a local-dir or fixture-repo source) → it appears in the sources list.
3. **Browse packs** → packs show description + declared entities.
4. **Install** a pack to a scope → its entities appear and resolve on `#/roles` / `#/tools` / `#/skills`, each tagged with the **specific pack**: scope badge present (`user` for global-user) AND `originPackName` chip/tooltip matches the installed pack (§5.2).
5. **Persists across reload.**
6. **Provenance** shown (source + version/commit + date).
7. **Update** (re-sync after upstream change reflected) and **Uninstall** (entities disappear; exactly what install added is removed).
8. **Source-level trust warning** is shown in the Add-source panel, with a "Why?" disclosure (collapsed by default) that expands to the per-entity-type threat model; no per-pack confirmation appears before install.
9. **Conflict warning icon** appears when two installed packs define the same entity name; **drag-reorder** (which calls `PUT /api/marketplace/pack-order`) flips the winner and the warning/`origin` updates after re-resolve. Persists across reload.

### 12.4 Acceptance-criterion → test map

| Acceptance criterion | Test |
|---|---|
| Market button between Workflows and New Goal | E2E #1 |
| Register source + browse packs | E2E #2–3 |
| Install copies dir; entities resolve via single resolver tagged with pack origin | E2E #4 + unit #4,#7 |
| Existing overrides resolve identically | §12.1 suite + unit #5 |
| Provenance + update + uninstall (removes exactly what was added) | E2E #6–7 + unit #7 |
| Same-name conflicts → warning + configured precedence (`pack_order` reorder) | E2E #9 + unit #2,#4 (pack_order reordering) |
| Entities tagged with the specific pack as origin | E2E #4 (originPackName) |
| `disabled_config_directories` now enforced for skills | unit #6 |
| Source-level trust warning + "Why?" disclosure in Add-source panel | E2E #8 |
| Re-sync + re-install reflects upstream | E2E #7 + unit #8 |

## 12.5 File / module change list

Concrete ownership boundaries for the high-blast-radius refactor. **New** modules vs **edited** modules:

**New (server):**
- `src/server/agent/pack-types.ts` — `PackManifest`, `PackMeta`, `PackEntry`, `EntityType`, `EntityLoader<T>`, `LoadedEntity<T>`, `ResolvedEntity<T>` interfaces.
- `src/server/agent/pack-manifest.ts` — `pack.yaml` / `.pack-meta.yaml` read + write + validation (incl. `contents.mcp` rejection, name guard).
- `src/server/agent/pack-resolver.ts` — `PackResolver` pipeline + the Role/Tool/Skill `EntityLoader`s (delegating parse to extracted helpers below).
- `src/server/agent/pack-list.ts` — `buildPackList(opts)` (§6.5): the legacy→unified mapping (cascade layers + skill scan dirs + `config_directories` + `disabled_config_directories`).
- `src/server/agent/marketplace-source-store.ts` — `MarketplaceSourceStore` (sources YAML CRUD).
- `src/server/agent/marketplace-install.ts` — git sync, `installPack`/`uninstallPack`/`updatePack`, atomic staging, recursive copy helper.

**Edited (server):**
- `src/server/agent/config-cascade.ts` — `resolveRoles`/`resolveTools` become adapters over `PackResolver`; **`resolveWorkflows`/`resolveToolGroupPolicies` untouched** (§2.2 note).
- `src/server/skills/slash-skills.ts` — `discoverSlashSkills`/`getSkillDirectories` become adapters over `PackResolver` (§6.4); keep TTL cache, `userInvocable` filter, sort, `source` derivation.
- `src/server/agent/builtin-config.ts` — extract shared `parseRoleYaml` / `parseToolsDir` (used by builtin entry + loaders); builtin pack entry creation.
- `src/server/agent/project-config-store.ts` — add scoped `pack_order` map migrated native-YAML field (mirror `config_directories`); project store holds `pack_order.project`, server store holds `pack_order.{server,global-user}` (§3.3); keep reading legacy keys.
- `src/server/server.ts` — add `/api/marketplace/*`, `/api/marketplace/pack-order` (GET/PUT, §9.2), and `/api/packs/conflicts` routes (§9); wire resolver-cache + slash-skills TTL invalidation on install/uninstall/update/reorder; `/api/roles|tools|skills` now read from `PackResolver` and emit `originPackId`/`originPackName` + `user` origin.
- `src/server/agent/config-directories.ts` — **unchanged behaviour**; its helpers are now consumed by `buildPackList` (legacy keys still read).

**Untouched (explicit non-goals):** `src/server/mcp/mcp-manager.ts`, `src/server/agent/system-prompt.ts`.

**New (UI):**
- `src/app/marketplace-page.ts` — the Market surface (sources / browse / installed / conflicts), reusing `config-scope.ts` helpers.

**Edited (UI):**
- `src/app/sidebar.ts` — Market button between Workflows and New Goal.
- `src/app/routing.ts` — register `market` route + `isMarketActive`.
- `src/app/api.ts` — marketplace fetch wrappers (incl. pack-order GET/PUT).
- `src/app/config-scope.ts` — extend `ConfigOrigin` to include `user` + badge class; render `originPackName` chip/tooltip.
- Roles/Tools/Skills pages — no structural change beyond the pack chip (badges already generic; §10.3).

**Tests:** new unit specs (§12.2), new `tests/e2e/ui/marketplace.spec.ts` (§12.3); existing regression suite (§12.1) must stay green.

## 13. Implementation order (suggested)

1. **Types + parsers** — `PackManifest`/`PackMeta`/`PackEntry`/loader interfaces; `pack.yaml`/`.pack-meta.yaml` read-write; unit tests #1.
2. **PackResolver + loaders** — pipeline + Role/Tool/Skill loaders; unit tests #2–3.
3. **`buildPackList`** — the legacy mapping (§6); A/B equivalence tests #5; keep `ConfigCascade`/`discoverSlashSkills` as adapters delegating to the resolver; run full §12.1 suite green.
4. **Source store + git sync + file ops** — install/uninstall/update; unit tests #7–8.
5. **REST endpoints** (§9).
6. **UI** — Market button + marketplace page reusing config-scope conventions; E2E suite #12.3.
7. **Conflict surfacing + `pack_order`** persistence (per-conflict pinning deferred).

Each step lands behind passing tests; step 3 is the high-blast-radius gate — do not proceed to UI until the full existing suite is green on the resolver swap.
