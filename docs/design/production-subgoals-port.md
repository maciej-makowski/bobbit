# Production Sub-Goals — Porting Design (from PR #497)

## Summary

Port the complete nested sub-goals system from PR #497
(`origin/goal/audit-subg-225e4d3d`) onto the goal branch, **excluding LSP**
(~57 files) and without re-introducing marketplace (already on master).

#497's merge-base is `21e80e3d`, which is essentially current `master` minus
one perf commit — so shared files have **not** diverged. This makes a
*verbatim file-level port* (`git checkout origin/goal/audit-subg-225e4d3d --
<file>`) the correct, low-risk strategy. Only shared files that also carry LSP
wiring need a surgical edit to strip the LSP lines.

## Scope decisions

- **In scope:** everything in #497 *except* LSP. This includes nesting-limit
  governance, spawn/merge backend, plan-mutation + divergence policy,
  pause/resume cascade, cost roll-up, proposal-modal subgoal controls +
  Workflow/Roles tabs, sidebar nesting, Plan/Children dashboard tabs, the nine
  `Children` tools + renderers, and all associated tests.
- **Out of scope (do NOT port):** every `src/server/lsp/**`,
  `defaults/tools/lsp/**`, `*lsp*` renderer, `*lsp*` doc, and `*lsp*` test.
  Also strip LSP wiring (imports, tool-group entries, system-prompt hints,
  role-yaml `Lsp` policies, renderer-registry LSP entries) from otherwise
  in-scope shared files.
- **Marketplace:** already merged to master; **not** part of #497's diff. Do
  not touch.

## Authoritative file inventory (port verbatim)

Each shared-file group below is tagged with the **specific subgoals concern**
it carries, so the porting coder takes only the subgoal-relevant delta and not
incidental #497 drift. For broad shared files (`project-context.ts`,
`project-registry.ts`, `search/flex-store.ts`, `preview/path-guard.ts`,
`rpc-bridge.ts`, manager-page UIs), **diff against master first and port only
hunks that reference subgoal/nested/children/plan/pause/cost symbols** — if a
hunk is unrelated to sub-goals, leave it out.

### Frontend — `src/app/**`, `src/ui/**`, `src/shared/**` (Coder B)
Rationale tags: proposal-panels = **subgoal toggle + max-depth + Workflow/Roles
tabs**; subgoals-flag/settings-page/main/remote-agent = **system pref +
dataset mirror**; sidebar-* /render-helpers = **nesting hierarchy + badges**;
goal-dashboard*/plan-* = **DAG plan/children tabs**; Goal*Renderer/children-* =
**Children tool cards**; api/state/message-reducer/custom-messages = **REST
client + WS state**. The detailed UX requirements these must satisfy:

- **Plan tab inline nested disclosure:** a chevron on a child node expands that
  child's plan recursively (depth cap 3); overflow collapses to a
  "Show N more…" affordance. `plan-live-only-toggle` (`data-testid`) defaults
  to inclusive (shows archived, dimmed/dashed with `plan-node-archived-pill`).
  Per-node gate status pending/running/passed/failed/bypassed; merge/conflict state per
  child. Source DAG from `GET /descendants` (live + archived), not the
  archived-filtered sidebar list.
- **Sidebar:** children nest under their spawning team-lead
  (`spawnedBySessionId`, resolved at spawn + render-side fallback); parent rows
  show a `sidebar-descendant-badge` descendant count; **same-titled siblings
  get a disambiguation suffix**; depth-5 sidebar cap; live/archived/blocked
  children visually distinguished.
- **Approval surfaces (both):** the in-chat `<children-mutation-approval>`
  custom message **and** a dashboard **mutation-pending card** (driven by the
  `mutation_pending` broadcast), both POSTing
  `/mutation/:requestId/decision`.
`subgoals-flag.ts`, `proposal-panels.ts` (subgoal toggle, max-depth control,
Workflow/Roles tabs), `settings-page.ts` (Subgoals toggle +

Port all `tests/**` named in #497 except `*lsp*`/`tests/lsp/**`/
`tests/fixtures/lsp-ts/**`: the unit suites (`subgoal-nesting-limit`,

`goal-descendants`, `child-ready-to-merge-helper`, `runSubgoalStep-*`,
`children-tool-renderers`, `sidebar-spawned-children`, `subgoals-flag`,

(`api-goals-spawn-child-route`, `api-subgoals-disabled`,
`subgoal-nesting-limit`, `subgoals-experimental-toggle`,
`plan-tab-archived-children`, `plan-archived-children`,
`sidebar-spawned-children-dedupe`, `tree-cost-rollup`, `cost-backfill-on-boot`,

`mock-agent-core.mjs`, `spec-framework.ts`, `dom-stub.ts`,
`helpers/run-subgoal-step-fixture.ts`).

## Key behavioural invariants (from spec, pinned by ported tests)

- Depth = parent hops + 1 (root = 1), cycle-guarded bounded walk.
- System ceiling `maxNestingDepth` (default 3, clamp 1..10) is a hard cap;
  per-goal override can only **tighten**; children inherit parent's effective
  flags. Team-lead at `depth == maxDepth` cannot spawn any child.
- Server-side enforcement on both spawn paths: `403 SUBGOALS_DISABLED` /
  `403 NESTING_DEPTH_EXCEEDED`.
- System `subgoalsEnabled` is the master gate; **defaults OFF**, aligned with
  #497 (an earlier production deviation that flipped it ON has been reverted —
  unset/missing reads as disabled, only an explicit `true` enables it).
- Children merge locally into parent branch (`git merge --no-ff`); only root
  raises a PR; conflicts `git merge --abort` + preserve child.
- Per-root concurrency semaphore (default 5, floor 1, max 8) is the scheduler.
  The shared `ChildTeamScheduler` (`child-team-scheduler.ts`, owned by the
  harness, reached by the REST routes via `verificationHarness.requestChildStart`
  / `notifyChildTerminal`) is the SINGLE authority for ALL child-team starts —
  harness `runSubgoalStep`, REST `spawn-child`, `POST /api/goals` child
  creation, and `integrate-child` dependency auto-unblock. At cap a child is
  created/parked `state='blocked'` (capacity-blocked) and enqueued FIFO; a
  terminal event (merge/archive/completion) releases the permit and starts the
  next eligible child (no poll loop). `POST /api/goals` with `parentGoalId` is
  refused with `409 GOAL_PAUSED` when the parent or any paused ancestor is
  paused (`requireAncestorsNotPaused`). Harness Tier-3 existing-child handling
  is state-aware: `blocked`→release/wait/reacquire, `todo`/awaiting→start under
  the permit, `in-progress`→wait.
- Plan mutation classifier (`noop`/`fix-up`/`expansion`/`restructure`/
  `criteria-drop`); criteria-drop always rejected; divergence policy matrix
  (`strict`/`balanced`/`autonomous`); `replanCount > 5` auto-pauses.
- Pause/resume cascade requires `{cascade}` (`422 CASCADE_REQUIRED`); every
  spawn path returns `409 GOAL_PAUSED`; boot respawn supervisor skips paused
  goals.

## Production deviation from #497 (reverted)

An earlier production build deviated from #497 by flipping the
`subgoalsEnabled` default from `false` to `true` in `readSubgoalNestingPrefs` /
the system prefs default. **That deviation has been reverted**: the default is
now `false` (OFF), matching #497. Every `subgoalsEnabled !== false` (unset →
enabled) read was inverted to `subgoalsEnabled === true` (unset → disabled), and
the UI dataset mirror (`document.documentElement.dataset.subgoalsEnabled`)
defaults to `"false"` when the preference is unset. Sub-goals are now an
experimental, opt-in feature; the user enables them via
Settings → System → General → Subgoals. There are no remaining intentional
behavioural deviations from #497.

## Architecture / API contracts (self-contained)

All nested-goal routes live in `nested-goal-routes.ts`, dispatched from
`server.ts::handleApiRoute()`. Enforcement is funnelled through single-source
helpers so REST and the verification harness share one code path:
`subgoal-nesting-limit.ts` (`checkCanSpawnChild`), `goal-paused-guard.ts`
(pause gate), `child-ready-to-merge.ts` (RTM), `plan-mutation.ts`
(classifier), `parent-workflow-freeze.ts` (freeze).

### REST endpoints
- `POST /api/goals/:id/spawn-child` — body `{ planId, title, spec,
  dependsOn?: string[], workflowId?, suggestedRole?, inlineWorkflow?,
  inlineRoles? }`. Idempotent on `planId`. Errors: `409 GOAL_PAUSED`,
  `400 SPEC_TOO_SHORT`, `403 SUBGOALS_DISABLED`,
  `403 NESTING_DEPTH_EXCEEDED {currentDepth,maxDepth}`,
  `400 SELF_DEPENDENCY|UNKNOWN_PLAN_ID|DEPENDS_ON_CYCLE`. Children inherit the
  root repo path (cwd derived via `path.relative` offset) and the parent's
  effective `subgoalsAllowed`/`maxNestingDepth`. Stamps `spawnedFromPlanId`,
  `dependsOnPlanIds`, `spawnedBySessionId`, `parentGoalId` immediately.
- `GET /api/goals/:id/plan` — returns the execution-gate subgoal steps + their
  state; `frozen` reflects `gate.metadata.frozen === "true"`.
- `PATCH /api/goals/:id/plan` — body `{ proposedSteps[] }`; requires an
  `execution` gate (`409 NO_EXECUTION_GATE`); validates each step
  (`400 INVALID_PLAN_STEP`); runs depends-on validation then the mutation
  classifier. Verdicts: `criteria-drop`→`409 CRITERIA_DROP`;
  `restructure` on non-paused goal→`409 RESTRUCTURE_REQUIRES_PAUSE`; `noop`
  no-op; `fix-up` auto-applies under `balanced`/`autonomous`; otherwise an
  approval request is persisted (24h TTL) for `POST /mutation/:requestId/decision`.
- `POST /api/goals/:id/integrate-child/:childId` — requires child RTM
  (`409 RTM_NOT_PASSED`) and matching parent (`400 PARENT_MISMATCH`); merges
  the child branch locally into the parent.
- `POST /api/goals/:id/pause` and `/resume` — body `{ cascade: boolean }`
  required (`422 CASCADE_REQUIRED`); optional `childGoalId` must be a direct
  child (`403 NOT_DIRECT_CHILD`). Pause soft-aborts subtree sessions and
  cancels in-flight verifications; resume re-enables spawns.
- `POST /api/goals/:id/mutation/:requestId/decision` — body `{ approve }`;
  applies or rejects a pending plan mutation.
- `PATCH /api/goals/:id/policy` — body `{ divergencePolicy?, maxConcurrentChildren? }`.
  The route itself accepts **any goal id** and persists the fields on that
  goal record: `divergencePolicy` (`strict`/`balanced`/`autonomous`) is a
  **per-goal** setting consulted by that goal's own plan-mutation handler;
  `maxConcurrentChildren` (validated `[1,8]`) is stored per-goal but **enforced
  at the root** — the spawn scheduler resolves the *root's* value via
  `resolve-root-max-concurrent-children` for the per-root semaphore, so in
  practice operators set concurrency on the root (`goal_set_policy` is
  documented root-oriented for that field). On success broadcasts
  `goal_state_changed` with the new values.
- `GET /api/goals/:id/descendants` — live + archived descendants for the Plan
  tab (independent of the sidebar's archived filter).
- `GET /api/goals/:id/tree-cost` — cost/token rollup rooted at the requested
  goal across its subtree (live + archived), surviving purge via `goalId`
  stamping on cost records.

### Children-mutation authorization (S1 — two classes)

The mutating Children REST endpoints are reachable by anything holding gateway
credentials, so they are guarded server-side by `authorizeChildrenMutation`
(`src/server/auth/children-mutation-authz.ts`). Because agents read the
**shared admin Bearer token** off disk and any holder of it can mint the
server-issued `bobbit_session` cookie, the cookie is only a **weak human
signal**. To shrink the blast radius the mutations are split into two classes:

- **`orchestration`** — `spawn-child`, plan `PATCH`, `integrate-child`,
  `policy`. The autonomous team-lead verbs (spawn child teams, rewrite the
  plan, merge child branches, resize concurrency). The web UI never issues
  these. They are **team-lead-only**: require an `X-Bobbit-Spawning-Session`
  header matching the goal's authoritative team-lead, and the cookie does
  **NOT** bypass. Refused on absent header / teamless goal / mismatch
  (`403 NOT_TEAM_LEAD`).
- **`operator`** — `pause`, `resume`, mutation `decision`, `archive-child`.
  The human-in-the-loop verbs the web UI actually drives. A verified
  `bobbit_session` cookie is accepted (human/UI), else the same team-lead
  match applies.

The header is never trusted as a bare claim — only compared for equality
against `TeamManager.getTeamState(goalId)?.teamLeadSessionId`.

**Residual risk (accepted; future work).** The `operator` endpoints still
trust the shared admin Bearer token: any token holder can mint the
`bobbit_session` cookie and drive the operator verbs. This is an **inherent
property of Bobbit's single shared-credential model** — agents and the human
share one gateway token, so the cookie path cannot cryptographically
distinguish a human operator from a token-holding agent. **Full separation
requires a dedicated operator credential** (a distinct human-only secret that
agents never possess), which is out of scope for this port and tracked as
future work. The orchestration/operator split removes the cookie bypass from
the high-impact orchestration surface without claiming to fully isolate the
operator surface.

### Persisted `PersistedGoal` fields (owned by `goal-store.ts`)
`parentGoalId?`, `subgoalsAllowed?`, `maxNestingDepth?`,
`divergencePolicy?`, `maxConcurrentChildren?`, `spawnedFromPlanId?`
(idempotency key, stamped synchronously after `createGoal`),
`dependsOnPlanIds?`, `spawnedBySessionId?`, `paused?`, `replanCount?`.

### Children tools (team-lead only; `always-allow` team-lead / `never`
contributors via `tool-group-policies.yaml` Children group)
`goal_spawn_child`, `goal_plan_propose`, `goal_plan_status`,
`goal_merge_child`, `goal_pause`, `goal_resume`, `goal_archive_child`,
`goal_decide_mutation`, `goal_set_policy` — thin wrappers over the REST
contracts above.

## Governance: mutation classifier & divergence matrix (exact, from `plan-mutation.ts`)

`classifyMutation()` is a **pure** module (no I/O). It diffs the frozen
`execution.verify[]` subgoal steps (`current`) against `proposed`, keying by
`planId`. Field precedence: top-level `title`/`spec`/`dependsOn` win over
nested `subgoal.*` (one-shot `console.warn` on conflict). It computes
`{added, removed, modified, phaseChanges}` where a step is `modified` if any of
title/spec/workflowId/suggestedRole/phase/dependsOn changed.

**Structural severity** (`noop < fix-up < expansion < restructure`):
1. no add/remove/modify → `noop`.
2. any `removed` → `restructure`.
3. else any existing step's phase **decreased** → `restructure`.
4. else a new step at phase `> max(current.phase)` **or** an existing step's
   phase **increased** → `expansion`.
5. else (only adds/modifies at non-increasing phase) → `fix-up`.
6. **dependsOn override:** a changed dep set on an *existing* step bumps a
   `noop`/`fix-up` up to `restructure`.

**Criteria-coverage override (always wins):** build a haystack =
`normalise(rootSpec)` ∪ `normalise(proposed[i].spec)` joined by newline, where
`normalise = collapse-whitespace → trim → toLocaleLowerCase("en")`. For each
root acceptance criterion, if its normalised form is **not** a substring of the
haystack it is uncovered. Any uncovered criterion forces `kind =
"criteria-drop"` and populates `uncoveredCriteria[]`. This is why specs must
quote criteria **verbatim under a `## Covers` heading** — the match is a
whitespace-normalised, locale-pinned-`en`, case-insensitive substring test
(not a hash), so paraphrasing capitalisation/whitespace is tolerated but
dropping the text is not. Locale is pinned to `en` so a Turkish-locale `İ`
does not spuriously fail.

**Binding decision matrix** (applied in the `PATCH /plan` handler, per-goal
`divergencePolicy`, default `balanced`):

| kind | strict | balanced | autonomous |
|---|---|---|---|
| `criteria-drop` | `409 CRITERIA_DROP` | `409 CRITERIA_DROP` | `409 CRITERIA_DROP` |
| `restructure` (goal not paused) | `409 RESTRUCTURE_REQUIRES_PAUSE` | `409 RESTRUCTURE_REQUIRES_PAUSE` | `409 RESTRUCTURE_REQUIRES_PAUSE` |
| `restructure` (paused) | approval | approval | approval |
| `expansion` | approval | approval | approval |
| `fix-up` | approval | apply directly | apply directly |
| `noop` | apply (no-op) | apply (no-op) | apply (no-op) |

"approval" = persist a `PendingMutation` (`requestId`, 24h `DEFAULT_MUTATION_TTL_MS`,
restart-safe via `plan-mutation-store`), broadcast `mutation_pending`, respond
`{requiresApproval:true, requestId}`; resolved via
`POST /mutation/:requestId/decision`. Each applied mutation increments
`replanCount`; `replanCount > 5` auto-pauses the goal.

## Spawn idempotency & partial-failure boundary
`spawn-child` is idempotent on `planId`: before creating, the handler checks
for an existing child whose `spawnedFromPlanId === planId` and returns it
instead of creating a duplicate. `spawnedFromPlanId` is stamped **synchronously
immediately after `createGoal` with no intervening awaits**, so the
duplicate-prevention key is durable before any async work. If a crash occurs
between `createGoal` and stamping (the only unstamped window), the boot
`backfillCompleteState`/recovery pass reconciles; a retried spawn with the same
`planId` is matched by the idempotency check once stamped, preventing duplicate
children.

## Execution plan (parallel, file-disjoint)

1. **Coder A — backend** (`src/server/**`, `defaults/**`): checkout listed
   files from the ref, strip LSP wiring, flip the prefs default, get the
   server half of `npm run check` green.
2. **Coder B — frontend** (`src/app/**`, `src/ui/**`, `src/shared/**`):
   checkout listed files, strip LSP renderers/wiring, get the web half of
   `npm run check` green. Backend & frontend share **no files**; type
   contracts come from the same source so they stay consistent.
3. **Coder C — tests** (after A+B merge): port test suites + harness deltas,
   get `npm run test:unit` and `npm run test:e2e` green.

Coders A and B run in parallel (disjoint paths). Coder C depends on both.

## Verification

- `npm run check` (server + web) clean.
- `npm run test:unit`, `npm run test:e2e` green.
- Clean diff: `git diff --name-only master | grep -i lsp` returns nothing;
  no marketplace modules touched.
- Browser E2E coverage for **every** user-facing surface via the ported
  suites, one per capability:
  - Proposal Allow-subgoals toggle + Max-depth control + Workflow/Roles tabs →
    `e2e/ui/subgoals-experimental-toggle`, `goal-proposal-form`.
  - Settings Subgoals toggle + `general-max-nesting-depth` stepper persistence
    across reload → `subgoals-experimental-toggle`.
  - Sidebar nesting, descendant badge, sibling disambiguation, dedupe →
    `e2e/ui/sidebar-spawned-children-dedupe`.
  - Plan tab DAG, archived distinction, live-only toggle, inline disclosure →
    `e2e/ui/plan-tab-archived-children`, `plan-archived-children`.
  - Children tab + tree-cost rollup → `e2e/ui/tree-cost-rollup`,
    `cost-backfill-on-boot`.
  - Children tool renderers + mutation-approval card →
    `e2e/ui/children-tool-renderers`.
  - Spawn refusal / nesting limit (API + UI) →
    `e2e/api-goals-spawn-child-route`, `api-subgoals-disabled`,
    `e2e/ui/subgoal-nesting-limit`.
  - Pause/resume cascade persistence → `e2e` pause-cascade suites.
  Any ported capability lacking a browser E2E in #497 gets a new one before the
  documentation gate (per AGENTS.md: nav, happy path, persistence across
  reload, cleanup).
