# Unified Message Ordering Reducer — Design Doc

Status: design / not yet implemented. Branch `goal/unified-me-c6054622`.
Companion to [`streaming-dedup-reorder.md`](./streaming-dedup-reorder.md), which fixes
**transport-level** dedup; this doc fixes **client-state-level** ordering.

---

## 1. Problem

Messages render out-of-order in the chat history, especially around widget-style
assistant turns (`propose_*`, `ask_user_choices`). Symptoms self-correct on the
next event in some cases and stay wedged until manual reload in others. The
streaming-dedup-reorder fix solved the wire path, but `_state.messages` is
still mutated by **eleven** independent call sites in `src/app/remote-agent.ts`
with no shared ordering key.

## 2. Root cause (one paragraph)

There is no single source of truth for transcript order. Live `event` frames
carry `seq`; everything else (snapshots, `tool_permission_needed`, optimistic
echoes, compaction placeholders, error rows, notifications) does not. The
client compensates with eight overlapping mechanisms — `_deferredAssistantMessage`,
`_liveEventMessages`, `_pendingPermissionCards`, `_compactionSyntheticMessages`,
text-equality optimistic dedup, snapshot-merge stable sort, slice-truncation
on permission inserts, and index-based render keys. Three failure modes:
**(A)** an assistant message that carries a `tool_use` block lands in the
single mutable `_deferredAssistantMessage` slot waiting for a future event to
flush it; a second deferred message silently overwrites the first; **(B)** a
mid-flight `messages` snapshot clears the deferred slot without flushing it,
so the widget vanishes from the transcript with no rendering signal;
**(C)** the snapshot path stable-sorts by `(timestamp, insertionOrder)` while
live ingestion appends — same data, two orderings. `MessageList.buildRenderItems`
then keys by array index (`msg:${i}`) so any reorder cascades DOM recreation
through every row downstream, resetting widget state.

## 3. Wire-format additions (additive)

### 3.1 What gets stamped, where

| Frame | Field added | Source | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| `{type:"event"}` | `seq`, `ts` (existing) | `EventBuffer.push` | `agent/session-manager.ts::emitSessionEvent` (already lives there) |
| `{type:"tool_permission_needed"}` | `seq`, `ts` | new helper `emitSessionFrame()` that wraps non-event broadcasts through `EventBuffer.pushFrame()` | Single allocation site: `agent/session-manager.ts::requestToolGrant`, which stashes the returned `{seq, ts}` on `pendingGrantRequest`. The on-attach replay branch in `ws/handler.ts` reuses those stashed values via `getPendingToolPermission()` and must NOT call `pushFrame()` again — doing so leaves a hole in the live-seq stream of already-attached clients. See [`perm-frame-late-joiner-seq-replay.md`](./perm-frame-late-joiner-seq-replay.md). |
| `{type:"messages"}` snapshot | per-message `_order: number` (negative integers, see §3.2) | `getArchivedMessages` / `rpcClient.getMessages` post-processor | `ws/handler.ts:284, 316, 509, 593` |
| `{type:"resume_gap"}` | `lastSeq` (existing) | unchanged | unchanged |

Two new helpers in `src/server/agent/event-buffer.ts`:

```ts
/** Like push() but for non-`event` frames that need a seq for client ordering.
 *  Stamps but does NOT retain in the ring buffer (resume catch-up uses
 *  rebroadcastable events only — permission frames are republished via the
 *  on-attach branch in `ws/handler.ts`, which replays the original `seq`/`ts`
 *  stashed on `pendingGrantRequest` rather than allocating a new frame —
 *  see `perm-frame-late-joiner-seq-replay.md`). */
pushFrame(): { seq: number; ts: number };

/** Floor sentinel reserved for snapshot ordering. All snapshot `_order`
 *  values are strictly less than every live `seq`. */
static readonly SNAPSHOT_ORDER_FLOOR = -1_000_000_000;
```

### 3.2 Snapshot `_order` numbering

**Choice: negative integers, position-derived.** For a snapshot of N messages,
message at index `i` (0-based) gets `_order = -1_000_000_000 + i`. Since live
`seq` starts at `1` and is positive, the invariant **`snapshotOrder < liveSeq`
for every (snapshot, live) pair** holds without coordination.

Rejected alternative `seq * 1000 + index`: requires the server to know the
client's current `_highestSeq`, which it doesn't (and shouldn't — snapshots
are stateless). Negative-floor numbering is purely a function of position.

When the client receives a snapshot it advances no `_highestSeq`. Live events
keep their own positive `seq`. The reducer's sort key `(_order, _insertionTick)`
naturally interleaves snapshot-derived rows before live-derived rows.

### 3.3 Backward compat

| Pairing | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| **Old client + new server** | New `_order` / `seq` fields are ignored (unknown JSON keys are inert). Old client keeps its 8-mechanism logic. No regression. |
| **New client + old server** | Snapshot messages arrive with no `_order`. Reducer derives a synthetic order from array index using the same `SNAPSHOT_ORDER_FLOOR + i` formula client-side (server stamping is purely an optimisation/canonicalisation). `tool_permission_needed` arrives with no `seq`; reducer assigns `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER - tick` sentinel (treated as "tail until proven otherwise") and keys reconciliation off the `(toolName, lastPromptText, timestamp)` triple as a last-resort. |
| **Old `.jsonl` lacking `seq`** | Out of scope (see goal spec). The reducer never reads `.jsonl`; it only consumes the snapshot the server hands it. |

## 4. Reducer module shape

New file: `src/app/message-reducer.ts`. **No imports from `./remote-agent`,
`./state`, `./render`, or anything DOM-touching.** Pure data only.

### 4.1 Augmented Message shape

```ts
export type MessageOrigin = "server" | "optimistic" | "synthetic" | "permission";

export interface OrderedMessage {
  /** All existing AgentMessage fields are preserved verbatim. */
  [k: string]: unknown;
  id?: string;
  role: string;
  timestamp?: number;
  /** Sort primary. Server-stamped (positive seq for live, negative for snapshot)
   *  or sentinel for optimistic/synthetic (see §5). */
  _order: number;
  /** Provenance — drives reconciliation rules (see §6). */
  _origin: MessageOrigin;
  /** Sort secondary. Monotonic counter incremented on every reduce. */
  _insertionTick: number;
}
```

### 4.2 Reducer state

```ts
export interface ReducerState {
  /** Sorted by (_order ASC, _insertionTick ASC). Render trusts verbatim. */
  messages: OrderedMessage[];
  /** Monotonic counter incremented on every reduce that adds an entry. */
  nextTick: number;
  /** Highest live seq we've consumed. Mirrors RemoteAgent._highestSeq for
   *  optimistic-sentinel reconciliation (§5). */
  highestSeq: number;
  /** Streaming preview message — not part of `messages`. Kept separately
   *  so render-time filter can hide it when its id appears in `messages`
   *  (replaces _deferredAssistantMessage). */
  streamingMessageId?: string;
}
```

### 4.3 Action union (covers all 11 mutation sites)

```ts
export type Action =
  | { type: "live-event";          frame: AgentEvent;           seq: number; ts: number }
  | { type: "snapshot";            messages: AnyMessage[]                         }   // server-authoritative
  | { type: "optimistic-prompt";   message: AnyMessage                            }   // tail sentinel
  | { type: "optimistic-steer";    message: AnyMessage                            }   // tail sentinel
  | { type: "permission-needed";   card: PermissionCard;        seq: number; ts: number }
  | { type: "permission-resolved"; messageId: string                              }   // grant or deny
  | { type: "compaction-placeholder"                                              }
  | { type: "compaction-result";   message: AnyMessage; success: boolean          }
  | { type: "system-notification"; message: AnyMessage                            }
  | { type: "error";               message: AnyMessage                            }
  | { type: "deny-permission-filter"; messageId: string                           };  // filter-only twin
```

### 4.4 Signature

```ts
export function reduce(state: ReducerState, action: Action): ReducerState;
```

Pure: no `Date.now()`, no `Math.random()`, no `this`, no DOM. The reducer
takes wall-clock timestamps from the action payload and tick from
`state.nextTick`. Tested via byte-equal fixture comparison.

### 4.5 Sort

After every reduce that touches `messages`, return a new array sorted by:

```ts
(a, b) => a._order - b._order || a._insertionTick - b._insertionTick
```

Stability-by-tick removes any ambiguity for entries that share an order
(two optimistic prompts pre-server-echo, two snapshot rows after a
zero-`seq` legacy server, etc.).

## 5. Per-action semantics

| Action | Effect on `messages` | `_order` source | Reconciliation |
|---|---|---|---|
| `live-event` (assistant message_end) | Append `{...msg, _order: seq, _origin:"server", _insertionTick}` | `seq` from frame | If `id` matches an existing entry → replace in place; else append. Streaming preview cleared by setting `streamingMessageId = msg.id` (rendered hidden). |
| `live-event` (user message_end) | Append, but first try id-match against `_origin:"optimistic"` rows; if no id-match, fall back to text equality (§6). On match: **replace** (keep new `_order`, keep new id, keep optimistic `attachments`/`skillExpansions` if missing on server msg). | `seq` | id ∨ text |
| `live-event` (toolResult) | Append. | `seq` | id |
| `snapshot` | Build new `messages = [...snapshotRows, ...survivingClientRows]` and re-sort. **Server snapshot is authoritative for any id it contains.** Drop client rows whose `id` is in snapshot. Additionally drop live server-origin `toolResult` rows whose `toolCallId` matches a snapshot toolResult, and live server-origin `assistant` rows whose content contains a `toolCall.id` matching a snapshot assistant toolCall — toolResult `message_end` frames often arrive without a string `id`, so id-only equivalence would let an un-id'd live row pass through alongside the snapshot's id'd copy. Drop `_origin:"synthetic"` compaction marker if any snapshot row is `assistant` with text starting `"Context compacted"`. Permission cards survive iff their `id` is not in snapshot **and** no snapshot row's `_order > card._order`. | `_order = -1e9 + i` for snapshot rows; client rows keep theirs | id ∨ text (compaction marker only) |
| `optimistic-prompt` | Append with sentinel `_order = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER - state.nextTick`. | sentinel | replaced by server echo via id-or-text rule |
| `optimistic-steer` | Same as prompt. | sentinel | id-or-text |
| `permission-needed` | Append `{...card, _order: seq, _origin:"permission"}`. **No slice-truncation.** Aborted-turn cleanup (formerly `messages.slice(0, lastUserIdx+1)`) is now a render-time concern: the streaming-message renderer filters tool calls whose result is "aborted-by-permission". | `seq` from frame | id |
| `permission-resolved` | Filter out the row by `id`. (Grant restarts the session; messages snapshot will be reissued by server.) | n/a | id |
| `compaction-placeholder` | Filter any existing `id === "compacting_placeholder"` then append `{role:"assistant", id:"compacting_placeholder", _order: highestSeq + 0.5, _origin:"synthetic"}`. The `+0.5` keeps it just-after the latest live event without colliding with an integer seq. | derived from `highestSeq` | id |
| `compaction-result` | Filter `id === "compacting_placeholder"`, append a new synthetic with `_order = highestSeq + 0.5`. Replaced/dropped on next snapshot if server has its own marker. | derived | id ∨ text-prefix `"Context compacted"` (snapshot path only) |
| `system-notification` | Append with `_order = highestSeq + 0.5 + tickFraction` (so multiple notifications in one tick stay ordered by `_insertionTick`). `_origin:"synthetic"`. | derived | none — synthetics stay client-side |
| `error` | Append with sentinel `_order = highestSeq + 0.5`. `_origin:"synthetic"`. Dismiss is the only mutation. | derived | id |
| `deny-permission-filter` | Filter row by `id`. (Twin of `permission-resolved` — issued from a UI click that doesn't yet have a server round-trip.) | n/a | id |

> **Rationale for `+0.5`:** `seq` is integer-monotonic on the server, so any
> fractional offset in `(integer, integer+1)` is collision-free with both
> live events and snapshot rows (snapshot rows are negative).

## 6. Optimistic message handling

### 6.1 Sentinel scheme

Optimistic prompts and steers use `_order = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER - state.nextTick`.

- **Tail-positioned by construction** — larger than any `seq` we'll ever see
  (server seqs are 32-bit-ish in practice, MAX_SAFE_INTEGER is 2^53−1).
- **Stable order between siblings** — `nextTick` decreases the value
  monotonically, so successive optimistic messages land in insertion order
  (later optimistic ⇒ smaller `_order` ⇒ comes *before* earlier — wait,
  that's wrong). **Corrected:** use `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER - (1e9 - nextTick)`
  — equivalently `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER - 1e9 + nextTick`. Forward-monotonic,
  still strictly larger than any real seq for any reasonable session.

### 6.2 Reconciliation when server echo arrives

On a `live-event` user message_end with text `T` and id `S`:

1. **id match** — find any optimistic row with `id === S`. Replace in place
   (keep new `_order = seq`, copy missing fields from optimistic).
2. **text fallback** — only if optimistic rows have ids matching
   `^optimistic_` (current convention) **and** no other optimistic row has the
   same `id`, find the most recent `_origin:"optimistic"` row whose
   `extractText() === T` and replace.
3. **No match** — append as new server row.

Text-fallback is bounded: at most one optimistic per turn is in flight, and
the search scope is `_origin:"optimistic"` only.

### 6.3 Settling unreconciled optimistic rows on turn termination

**Root cause.** §6.1's sentinel scheme assumes the reconciling echo in §6.2
*always arrives*. The "Race: snapshot arrival after pending optimistic" row in
§11 even leans on it ("the follow-up live echo at `seq = N` then replaces by
id"). That assumption is false when a turn **terminates before emitting the
user echo** — e.g. a prompt sent while the agent is idle on a model that 404s
immediately. The server never persists the prompt to the agent `.jsonl` and
never echoes it, so nothing ever replaces the optimistic row. Left at
`_order ≈ Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`, it sorts *after every server-ordered
message*, including ones that arrive or complete later (especially in team-lead
sessions, which receive independent server events — status polls, task-complete
notifications, snapshots). The user's earlier message renders permanently
stranded at the bottom of the transcript and is absent from the persisted
history (so it would vanish on reload). Reproduced live in session
`3d8bdbe4-ff32-415c-aaaa-a04590092152`.

**Chosen mechanism: a pure `settle-optimistic` reducer action.** It is
dispatched from `RemoteAgent` on **both** turn-termination paths — `case
"error"` in `handleServerMessage` and `case "agent_end"` in
`handleAgentEvent`. Settling only on turn termination (never eagerly) is what
distinguishes a genuine strand from the legitimate in-flight pending case.

**Settlement behaviour.** `settle-optimistic` re-stamps any `_origin:
"optimistic"` row still pinned at the sentinel (`_order >
OPTIMISTIC_ORDER_BASE`, where `OPTIMISTIC_ORDER_BASE = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER
- 1e9`) to `highestSeq + SETTLE_EPSILON` (`0.5`) — just after the latest live
message the client has consumed — so subsequent live server events naturally
sort *after* it. The row:

- **stays visible** — it is re-stamped, never deleted; the user needs to see
  what they sent;
- **keeps `_origin:"optimistic"` and its `optimistic_` id**, so a late,
  against-the-odds server echo can still reconcile it in place (id or text
  fallback) instead of stacking a duplicate;
- **is flagged `_settled: true`** (a durable marker — see snapshot behaviour).

Already-reconciled (now `_origin:"server"`) and already-settled rows are
untouched, so the action is a pure no-op on the happy path and idempotent on
re-dispatch (both `error` and `agent_end` may fire). The reducer stays pure —
no `Date.now()`, no DOM; `settleOrder` is derived from `state.highestSeq`.

A **pending** optimistic row (echo not yet arrived *and* turn not yet ended)
is deliberately left at the sentinel. That is the legitimate in-flight case
(§11 race row), not a strand, and the eventual echo will reconcile it.

**Snapshot behaviour (why `_settled` must be durable).** A snapshot is a
point-in-time read of the *persisted* transcript: every snapshot row lands in
the negative `SNAPSHOT_ORDER_FLOOR` (`-1e9 + i`) range and is therefore older
than a prompt the user just sent. A settled row's `highestSeq + 0.5` order is a
small positive value, so it already sorts *after the entire snapshot* — which is
**exactly right**: a failed prompt was sent after the persisted history, so it
belongs after it (it is the most recent action and lands at the bottom). The
`snapshot` survivor pass therefore leaves a `_settled` optimistic row's `_order`
**untouched** and simply keeps it visible.

> **Corrected contract (PR #827 review).** An earlier revision re-stamped the
> settled survivor to `serverMaxOrder - 0.5` ("keep it just below the snapshot
> tail"). That was wrong twice over: (1) for a snapshot whose rows are an
> ordinary old transcript `[old user, old assistant]`, `serverMaxOrder - 0.5`
> inserts the failed prompt *between* the two old rows — into older history;
> (2) the survivor pass ran the same-text dedup budget *before* the `_settled`
> branch, so a settled prompt sharing text with an old snapshot row was silently
> dropped, breaking the stays-visible contract. The fix removes the re-stamp and
> excludes `_settled` rows from the same-text dedup (that budget exists only to
> reconcile a **pending** optimistic row against a snapshot that beat its echo).

The `_settled` flag is gated against two things in the survivor pass: it skips
the same-text multiset dedup (settled rows must stay visible, never be consumed
by a budget meant for pending-echo reconciliation) and it is never re-stamped
into older history. **Pending** (un-`_settled`) optimistic rows are still left at
the sentinel so the legitimate pending case (test (5)) is preserved, and still
participate in the same-text dedup so a snapshot that beats the echo collapses
the duplicate. The `_settled` flag survives across reduces precisely so the pass
can keep distinguishing a settled survivor from a pending one.

**Tests.**

- `tests/message-reducer.test.ts` — pure-reducer suite **R1–R6**:
  - **R1** errored turn settles the prompt so a *later* live event sorts after
    it (and the row is not deleted);
  - **R2** a settled row survives an *independent* snapshot (no id/text match)
    and keeps its chronological position — it sorts *after* the negative-order
    snapshot transcript (the prompt was sent after that persisted history);
  - **R3** settle after the echo already reconciled is a no-op (happy path
    unchanged);
  - **R4** a late server echo still reconciles a *settled* row with no
    duplicate.
  - **R5** (PR #827 review issue 1) a settled row sharing text with a snapshot
    row stays visible — it is not consumed by the same-text dedup budget.
  - **R6** (PR #827 review issue 2) a failed prompt sent after an existing
    `[old user, old assistant]` transcript stays *after* the whole transcript
    on a subsequent same-transcript snapshot, never inserted into older history.
  - Corrected **case (5)** now asserts the *pending* contract: an optimistic
    row with no echo **and no turn-end** stays at the sentinel after a snapshot
    (previously this case enshrined the buggy permanent-tail ordering as if it
    were correct even post-termination).
- `tests/remote-agent-settle.spec.ts` — wiring spec that drives the bundled
  production handlers with a stub transport and asserts both the `error` and
  `agent_end` paths move the row out of the sentinel while keeping it visible.
  The assertions are **mechanism-agnostic** (they check observable `_order`
  relative to the sentinel floor, not an action name), so the wiring is pinned
  without coupling to the action's internals.

**Reverted-fix proof (for the PR description).** All of R1–R4 and the
`remote-agent-settle` spec are **RED before the production fix** — the reducer
returns `undefined` for the unknown `settle-optimistic` action and the handlers
never re-stamp, so the row stays at the sentinel (`_order > floor`) and every
"settled below the floor / sorts before later rows" assertion fails — and
**GREEN after**. This satisfies the goal's requirement that the new tests
demonstrably fail when the fix is reverted.

## 7. Render contract

### 7.1 Id-keyed render

`MessageList.buildRenderItems` (currently `src/ui/components/MessageList.ts:64`)
must key by **stable id**, never `msg:${i}`. Rule:

```ts
function keyFor(m: OrderedMessage, group?: string): string {
  if (group) return `${group}:${m.id ?? `synth:${m._origin}:${m._order}:${m._insertionTick}`}`;
  return m.id ?? `synth:${m._origin}:${m._order}:${m._insertionTick}`;
}
```

For the `tool-group` cross-message group, the key is
`group:${firstCall.id ?? synth:...}` so groups remain stable when adjacent
messages are inserted/removed.

### 7.2 No render-time sort

`MessageList` consumes `agent.messages` verbatim. It does not re-sort, dedupe,
or filter on order — those are reducer concerns. The only render-time filter
is **§7.3**.

### 7.3 Streaming-message filter (replaces `_deferredAssistantMessage`)

`AgentInterface` already passes `streamingMessage` and `messages` separately
to children. Add one render-side guard: when `state.streamingMessage?.id ===
m.id` for some `m ∈ messages`, hide that `m` from the message-list output
(the streaming container is already rendering it). The reducer's
`streamingMessageId` is the source of truth for which id is currently
duplicated in the streaming preview.

Result: `_deferredAssistantMessage` and its three call sites disappear. The
"don't show streaming message twice" guarantee is now a one-line filter, not
a stateful slot.

## 8. Deletion list

After this refactor, `grep -rn` over `src/app/` must return **zero hits** for
each of:

- `_deferredAssistantMessage` — currently `remote-agent.ts:52, 682, 869, 1513–1517, 1609, 1622`
- `_liveEventMessages` — currently `remote-agent.ts:71, 582, 606, 685, 892–909, 1660`
- `_pendingPermissionCards` — currently `remote-agent.ts:84, 741, 752, 942–954, 1254`
- `_compactionSyntheticMessages` — currently `remote-agent.ts:80, 560, 916–930, 1775`
- `flushDeferredMessage` — currently `remote-agent.ts:1513, 1532, 1563, 1622`

And these mechanisms collapse:

| # | Mechanism | Current site | Replacement |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Deferred assistant slot | `remote-agent.ts:52, 1609` | reducer + render-time streaming filter |
| 2 | Live-event bucket text-merge | `remote-agent.ts:71, 892` | id-based optimistic reconciliation in reducer |
| 3 | Pending-permission `maxServerTs` cutoff | `remote-agent.ts:942–954` | snapshot `_order` ≥ card `_order` rule |
| 4 | `tool_permission_needed` slice-truncation | `remote-agent.ts:1237–1241` | render-time filter on aborted tool calls |
| 5 | Compaction text-prefix match | `remote-agent.ts:881–890, 916` | id rule + single text fallback in `snapshot` action |
| 6 | Snapshot stable sort by `(timestamp, insertionOrder)` | `remote-agent.ts:962–973` | reducer's `(_order, _insertionTick)` sort |
| 7 | Optimistic text-equality dedup | `remote-agent.ts:1651–1665` | reducer's id-or-text rule, sentinel ordering |
| 8 | `MessageList` index-key `msg:${i}` | `MessageList.ts:117, 122, 169, 173` | id-or-synthetic key from §7.1 |

## 9. `RemoteAgent` glue

`RemoteAgent` keeps **transport** state and becomes a thin dispatcher.

### 9.1 Stays on `RemoteAgent`

- WS lifecycle (`ws`, `_highestSeq`, `_pendingEvents`, `_seqInitialized`,
  `_inResumeFallback`, resume/reconnect logic — see streaming-dedup-reorder.md).
- Subscriptions / event emitter (`subscribe`, `emit`).
- Status (`isStreaming`, `isAborting`, `turnStartTime`, `archivedAt`).
- Server queue mirror (`_serverQueue`).
- Project/preview/cost/preferences/skill-sidecar plumbing.
- Title and goal-setup callbacks.
- Tool-proposal panel detection (`_processedProposalIds`,
  `_checkToolProposals`, `_checkProposals`) — these inspect message content,
  not order, so they're unchanged.

### 9.2 Moves into `ReducerState`

- `_state.messages` → `reducerState.messages`.
- `_state.streamingMessage`'s "is this duplicated in messages" question →
  `reducerState.streamingMessageId` plus render filter.
- The four buckets (`_deferredAssistantMessage`, `_liveEventMessages`,
  `_pendingPermissionCards`, `_compactionSyntheticMessages`) — **deleted**,
  not relocated.

### 9.3 Sketch

```ts
class RemoteAgent {
  private reducerState: ReducerState = initialState();

  private apply(action: Action) {
    this.reducerState = reduce(this.reducerState, action);
    this._state.messages = this.reducerState.messages;        // for legacy readers
    this.emit({ type: "render" });
  }

  private async handleServerMessage(msg: any) {
    switch (msg.type) {
      case "messages":
        this.apply({ type: "snapshot", messages: msg.data?.messages ?? msg.data });
        // …non-message side effects: review pane, proposal scan, reconnect notif
        return;
      case "tool_permission_needed":
        this.apply({ type: "permission-needed", card: buildCard(msg), seq: msg.seq, ts: msg.ts });
        return;
      case "error":
        this.apply({ type: "error", message: buildErrorRow(msg) });
        return;
      case "event":
        // existing seq/ordering gate from streaming-dedup-reorder.md still applies
        this.handleAgentEvent(msg.data, msg.seq, msg.ts);
        return;
      // …state, session_status, queue_update etc. unchanged
    }
  }

  private handleAgentEvent(ev: any, seq: number, ts: number) {
    switch (ev.type) {
      case "message_end":
        this.apply({ type: "live-event", frame: ev, seq, ts });
        // existing proposal scan stays here
        return;
      case "message_update":  /* streaming preview only — no reduce */ return;
      case "compaction_start":
        this.apply({ type: "compaction-placeholder" });
        return;
      case "compaction_end":
        this.apply({ type: "compaction-result", message: buildCompactionRow(ev), success: !!ev.success });
        return;
      // …tool_execution_start/update/end unchanged (no transcript mutation)
    }
  }

  prompt(text: string, /* … */) {
    if (!this._state.isStreaming) {
      this.apply({ type: "optimistic-prompt", message: buildOptimistic(text, /* … */) });
    }
    this.send({ type: "prompt", text });
  }

  steer(message) { this.apply({ type: "optimistic-steer", message: buildOptimistic(...) }); this.send({ type: "steer", text }); }

  denyToolPermission(id, toolName) {
    if (toolName) this.send({ type: "deny_tool_permission", toolName });
    this.apply({ type: "deny-permission-filter", messageId: id });
  }

  reset() { this.reducerState = initialState(); /* … rest of reset */ }
}
```

`handleServerMessage` and `handleAgentEvent` shrink to ~150 lines each (down
from ~600 combined today), and every transcript mutation is one `apply()`.

## 10. Test plan

### 10.1 Unit — `tests/message-reducer.test.ts` (new)

Pure synchronous Node tests. No Playwright, no WS, no DOM. Each scenario is a
sequence of `Action`s applied to the initial state; assertion is byte-equal
on the resulting `messages.map(m => ({ id: m.id, _order: m._order, role: m.role }))`.

| # | Scenario | Action sequence | Expected (id, _order) order |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | In-order live | `live(seq=1,id=u1)`, `live(seq=2,id=a1)` | `[u1@1, a1@2]` |
| 2 | Out-of-order live (after seq gate) | `live(seq=2,id=a1)`, `live(seq=1,id=u1)` — gated upstream, but if reducer sees them out-of-order it still sorts | `[u1@1, a1@2]` |
| 3 | Duplicate live | `live(seq=1,id=u1)` ×2 | `[u1@1]` (id-replace, single row) |
| 4 | Snapshot mid-stream replaces by id | `live(seq=1,id=u1)`, `live(seq=2,id=a1)`, `snapshot([{id:u1},{id:a1,content:"updated"}])` | snapshot rows at `[-1e9, -1e9+1]`, content from server |
| 5 | Snapshot + optimistic survivor | `optimistic-prompt(id=opt1,text="hi")`, `snapshot([{id:srv1,role:user,text:"world"}])` | `[srv1@-1e9, opt1@MAXSAFE-…]` — optimistic kept (no id/text match) |
| 6 | Optimistic → echo (id) | `optimistic-prompt(id=opt1)`, `live(seq=1,id=opt1,role=user)` | `[opt1@1]` (replaced, no dup) |
| 7 | Optimistic → echo (text) | `optimistic-prompt(id=opt1,text="hi")`, `live(seq=1,id=srv1,role=user,text="hi")` | `[srv1@1]` |
| 8 | Proposal burst | `live(seq=1,id=a1,toolUse=propose_goal)`, `live(seq=2,id=a2,toolUse=propose_role)`, `live(seq=3,id=tr1,role=toolResult)` | `[a1@1, a2@2, tr1@3]` — both widgets present, no overwrite (kills Mode A) |
| 9 | ask_user_choices envelope routing | `live(seq=1,id=a1,toolUse=ask_user_choices,toolUseId=auc1)`, `live(seq=2,id=u1,role=user,text="[ask_user_choices_response tool_use_id=auc1]\n…")` | both rows present in order; envelope-scan helper finds row 2 by `auc1` |
| 10 | Reconnect with gap | `live(seq=1,id=u1)`, `live(seq=2,id=a1)`, `snapshot([u1,a1,u2,a2])` (live tail follows) , then `live(seq=5,id=a3)` | snapshot block at `[-1e9..-1e9+3]`, `a3@5` after; no dups |
| 11 | Permission insert + resolve | `live(seq=1,id=u1)`, `permission-needed(seq=2,id=p1)`, `permission-resolved(p1)` | `[u1@1]` — no slice-truncation of u1 |
| 12 | Compaction placeholder + server marker | `compaction-placeholder` → row `compacting_placeholder@hi+0.5`; then `snapshot([{id:cs1,role:assistant,text:"Context compacted from 12k tokens."}])` | single compaction row from server, synthetic dropped |

Pass criterion: byte-equal output array of `(id, _order)` pairs.

### 10.2 E2E — extend `tests/e2e/ui/stories-streaming.spec.ts`

| Story | User-visible assertion |
|---|---|
| **ST-DEDUP-02 — Proposal burst** | Mock agent emits two consecutive `propose_*` assistant turns + a toolResult. Both `<proposal-…>` widgets must render in order. Click the first → it submits; click the second → it submits. Neither is unmounted/remounted (assertion: stable `data-msg-key` between the two screenshots). |
| **ST-DEDUP-03 — Mid-burst reconnect** | While the proposal burst is mid-stream, kill the WS. Server resumes via `seq` replay. After reconnect, the widget appears **exactly once** in the transcript (assertion: `page.locator('proposal-goal').count() === 1`). |
| **ST-DEDUP-04 — `ask_user_choices` envelope routing** | Two `ask_user_choices` cards on screen. Click answer on card B; `[ask_user_choices_response tool_use_id=<toolUseId-B>]` user message arrives. Card B shows answer; card A unchanged (assertion: `findAskResponseAnswers` matches card B's `toolUseId`). |

### 10.3 Regression guard

- `tests/remote-agent-snapshot-merge.test.ts` — must still pass. Convert
  internally to call the new reducer (the test currently constructs a
  `RemoteAgent` and feeds frames via reflection; rewrite to construct
  `ReducerState` + `Action`s).
- `tests/e2e/ui/stories-streaming.spec.ts::RE-07` (preferences-snapshot
  ordering) — must still pass, no transport change.
- `tests/e2e/ui/stories-streaming.spec.ts::ST-DEDUP-01` — replay-pacing path
  is unchanged.
- Manual: open a session that previously showed the proposal-out-of-order
  symptom; confirm widgets are in order on first paint without reload.

## 11. Risk register

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| **RE-07 regression** — preferences snapshot relied on stable-by-timestamp ordering | The reducer preserves the same effective order (snapshot rows in array order, ties broken by `_insertionTick`). Add an explicit RE-07 fixture to the unit suite to lock the contract. |
| **ST-DEDUP-01 regression** — replay pacing | Untouched by this change. The reducer doesn't care whether events arrive paced or burst — it sorts by seq either way. |
| **`tests/remote-agent-snapshot-merge.test.ts`** — current test reaches into private buckets via reflection | Rewrite as reducer test (pure function, no reflection). Keeps the same behavioural assertions: server-snapshot id wins, compaction marker dedup by text, permission cards survive only when not superseded. |
| **Very-old persisted `.jsonl` lacking `seq`** | Server's `getMessages` always assigns `_order = -1e9 + i` from snapshot index, regardless of whether the underlying JSONL had `seq`. Old data is invisible to the reducer; it sees only the snapshot. |
| **Race: snapshot arrival after pending optimistic** | Optimistic rows sit at `_order ≈ MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`, so a snapshot that doesn't contain the optimistic id cannot displace it. The follow-up live echo at `seq = N` then replaces by id (or by text). Worst case: the optimistic row visibly persists for one extra render frame after the snapshot — same as today, no regression. **Caveat: this holds only while the echo is still pending. If the turn *terminates* without an echo (immediate model 404), the row must not stay at the sentinel — `settle-optimistic` re-stamps it into chronological position (§6.3).** |
| **`__preview_snapshot_v1__` marker interactions** | Reducer doesn't inspect tool-result text. Marker handling stays in `PreviewRenderer.ts` / `truncate-large-content.ts` and is not affected. |
| **Proposal scan double-fire** | `_processedProposalIds` is keyed by block id, not message position; safe across reducer migration. The streaming flag `state.proposalStreamingByTag` is similarly id-keyed (see `proposal-panel-streaming-ux.md`). |
| **AI Gateway / restart-resume reviewer reminder** | Verification harness uses `waitForIdle`/`waitForStreaming`, not transcript ordering. No coupling. |
| **Tool-group cross-message grouping (`MessageList.ts:138`)** breaks when key changes from index to id | The grouping logic walks the array, not keys. Group key becomes `group:${firstCall.id}` — stable across re-renders. Add a unit test for the group with three tool-only assistant turns. |
| **Old client + new server seqs on `tool_permission_needed`** | Old client ignores unknown `seq` field. New behaviour is purely additive. |
| **Backwards compat on snapshot `_order` from old server** | New client computes `_order = SNAPSHOT_ORDER_FLOOR + i` itself when the server didn't stamp it. End-to-end behaviour identical. |

## Acceptance pointer

This design satisfies all eight acceptance bullets in the goal spec:

1. Single `reduce()` in `src/app/message-reducer.ts`, `RemoteAgent` shrinks to dispatcher (§4, §9).
2. All eight mechanisms deleted (§8).
3. Server stamps `_order` on snapshot and `seq` on `tool_permission_needed` (single `pushFrame()` site in `requestToolGrant`; on-attach replay reuses the stashed `seq`/`ts` — see [`perm-frame-late-joiner-seq-replay.md`](./perm-frame-late-joiner-seq-replay.md)); old client / old server compat verified (§3).
4. 12 unit tests + 3 E2E stories specified (§10).
5. `npm run check` / `test:unit` / `test:e2e` clean — no breaking type changes; reducer is additive.
6. `docs/internals.md — Snapshot merge invariant` to be rewritten as "Reducer ordering invariant" (out of scope here, called out in implementation task).
7. `docs/design/streaming-dedup-reorder.md §4.5` carve-out for `_liveEventMessages` to be deleted (called out in implementation task).
8. Manual proposal-widget repro fixed (§10.2 ST-DEDUP-02).
