# PR walkthrough panel — MVP handoff

## Purpose

Build a preview-pane PR walkthrough UI that guides a human reviewer through a changeset with LLM assistance. The reviewer should feel like they are being walked through a PR by a senior engineer: first context, then architectural choices, then major changes, then omissions/other changes, then a remaining-lines audit.

The latest prototype was iterated in Bobbit preview during session [`0c159c64-f8cb-4b19-b395-d60db8de5061`](https://bobbit.dedyn.io:5173/session/0c159c64-f8cb-4b19-b395-d60db8de5061), using real inspiration from Bobbit PR #637, `Shrink Initial Bundle`.

The captured interactive HTML prototype is checked in at [`docs/design/pr-walkthrough-panel-prototype.html`](./pr-walkthrough-panel-prototype.html). **Treat that prototype as the target UX for the production implementation.** This markdown document is the supporting design narrative; if it conflicts with the prototype's visual hierarchy, density, navigation behaviour, or interaction details, the prototype wins unless the deviation is explicitly called out and accepted.

Production should be recognisably the same experience as the prototype, not merely a generic implementation of the same data model. Match the prototype's overall composition, header treatment, rail density, card hierarchy, diff presentation, comment affordances, and review controls as closely as Bobbit's shared app chrome/theme allow.

Current production is the built-in first-party pack panel (`market-packs/pr-walkthrough/`). The pack migration changes where the surface lives, not the UX bar: the panel must keep the prototype's header/stats/link/progress, full and collapsed rails, guided orientation, diff modes, line/card comment workflows, and `Prev` / `Like` / `Dislike` controls. Reload recovery and malformed-hunk resilience are part of the production contract; completed cards should recover in the reviewer child session, and bad hunk metadata must not blank the whole panel. See [../pr-walkthrough-panel.md](../pr-walkthrough-panel.md) for the current architecture and test matrix.

## Core experience

The walkthrough appears inside Bobbit's existing preview/side-panel surface, not inside the chat transcript.

Because the prototype was created in Bobbit preview and is the target UX, the production panel must support preview-pane ergonomics:

- it can be used in the normal side-panel beside chat;
- it can be full-screened from the side-panel toolbar like HTML preview panes;
- it can be opened in a new browser tab for wide review sessions.

The outer Bobbit chat remains available for asking the agent questions. The walkthrough panel itself does not need an Ask button or prompt composer.

Each walkthrough consists of phases:

0. **Orientation** — why the PR was raised, business value, need-to-know context.
1. **Key design choices** — architectural/design decisions made by the PR.
2. **Significant changes** — major, controversial, or review-worthy changes.
3. **Other changes + omissions** — secondary changes and missing expected artefacts such as tests/docs/migrations.
4. **Audit** — remaining plumbing/shrapnel. This is a normal diff-backed review card: items expand inline into diff blocks, support line and card comments, and participate in the same Like/Dislike flow as other cards. The audit card also includes the final draft review section assembled from accumulated decisions and comments.

Cards are LLM-synthesised logical change sets, not raw files/hunks. A card may contain multiple code blocks, including the audit card.

## Guided orientation beats (Phase 0 redesign)

> This supersedes the original "single orientation card" treatment. The orientation card previously joined its structured context fields into two `\n`-joined paragraphs; CSS collapsed the newlines into one space, producing an intimidating wall of text with the verdict, concerns, and reviewer file-map all buried. Phase 0 is now a guided step-through of bite-size beats. The production reference is the validated mockup `guided.html`; see [pr-walkthrough-panel.md](../pr-walkthrough-panel.md#guided-orientation-step-through) for the shipped behaviour.

**Structured `sections` model.** The orientation card carries an optional `sections: PrWalkthroughCardSection[]` array of single-idea "beats" (defined in `src/shared/pr-walkthrough/types.ts`). Each section has an `id`, a ≤3-word `navLabel`, a `heading`, optional `eyebrow`, `body`, and beat-specific payloads: `verdict` (recommendation + confidence + summary), `concerns` (severity-tagged rows), `fileRoles` (Core/Support/Verify/Docs), `showStats`, and `showOriginalDescription`. The server builds the six beats from the existing YAML `walkthrough.context` + `merge_assessment` — no new agent content is required — and the panel renders them as a stepper with Back/Next, a step counter, and per-beat rail circles (visited ✓ / current ring / upcoming hollow).

The six server-defined beats: **At a glance** (verdict badge + summary + diff stats), **Why it exists** (`why_created`), **What it changes** (`problem_solved`), **Should it be merged?**, **What to scrutinise** (concerns), **Where to look** (reviewer map + collapsible original PR description).

**Reframed merge beat.** The fourth beat is reframed from "Why it's worth merging" to the question **"Should it be merged?"** with answer-first copy: a recommendation line (`Yes — approve, medium confidence.` / `Not yet — request changes, …` / `Maybe — comment, …` / `Recommendation unclear.`) derived from `merge_assessment`, followed by `why_worth_merging`. The reviewer gets the verdict before the rationale.

**Compact rail labels.** Every rail entry uses a short label (`card.navLabel ?? deriveNavLabel(card.title)`) so titles never truncate in the narrow rail; the full title stays in the card `<h2>` and the rail tooltip. The agent may supply an optional `nav_label` per card in YAML (≤3 words / ≤24 chars), with a graceful server-derived fallback — see [pr-walkthrough-agent-ux.md](pr-walkthrough-agent-ux.md#compact-navigation-labels-nav_label).

`sections`, `navLabel`, and `nav_label` are all **optional and backward-compatible**: the `submit_pr_walkthrough_yaml` contract is unchanged and an orientation card without `sections` falls back to the legacy single-card body.

## Layout

- Header:
  - PR number/title, matching the prototype's prominent review-header treatment.
  - GitHub/GitStatus-style stats: `50 files`, green `+4,650`, red `-2,353`. Prefer explicit changeset stats from the launch source; otherwise derive file/addition/deletion counts from the rendered cards.
  - A GitHub/PR link affordance that behaves like the PR pill on the goal dashboard: when the walkthrough was launched from or can infer a GitHub PR, expose the PR number/title as an external link to GitHub.
  - Review progress.
  - Submit review button.
- Left rail:
  - Full-width mode: phase list with card substeps.
  - Narrow/half-width preview mode: very thin rail, ~38px, showing phase pips plus clickable card-dot substeps beneath each phase.
  - Text appears in native tooltips in collapsed mode.
- Main workspace:
  - Phase/card title and short narrative summary.
  - One or more diff blocks.
  - Card-level suggested concerns.
  - Prev / Dislike / Like controls.

## Diff display

- Full-width mode defaults to side-by-side diffs.
- Narrow/half-width mode defaults to inline diffs, but must not force it; the user can still choose side-by-side.
- There should be at most one horizontal scrollbar per diff widget. The scrollbar should move the whole code snippet and both sides together, not appear per overflowing line.
- Split diff rows must render line details for both old and new sides of paired rows. Old-side deletions and new-side additions can each have their own comments, LLM suggestions, and active editor; context rows may share details because they are one logical line.
- Diff blocks can be independently expanded/collapsed.
- Multiple code blocks per card are allowed and expected.

## Inline comments

- Hovering or clicking a diff line exposes a `+` affordance.
- Clicking a line opens an inline editor below that line.
- LLM-suggested comments should be line-anchored when possible.
- The user must always be able to write their own comment if the suggestions are not right.
- Saved comments show inline below the line and mark the line/file/card in the UI.
- Card-level comments are separate from line-level comments and support LLM-suggested broad concerns plus `Write your own`.

## Review controls

- **Like**:
  - Primary app button style: `var(--primary)` / `var(--primary-foreground)`.
  - Advances to the next card.
  - If comments exist, label can read `Like anyway` to clarify that notes are being retained while the card is accepted.
- **Dislike**:
  - Disabled until at least one line-level or card-level comment exists.
  - At rest, should look like Bobbit's other danger/terminate buttons: neutral/ghost.
  - It should only become red/destructive on hover/focus.
  - Advances to the next card and marks the card as requiring changes/comment attention.
- **Prev**:
  - Neutral ghost button.
  - Allows backtracking and updating prior answers.

## State model sketch

```ts
type WalkthroughPhaseId = 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4;

type WalkthroughCard = {
  id: string;
  phase: WalkthroughPhaseId;
  title: string;
  narrative: string;
  blocks: DiffBlockRef[];
  lineSuggestions?: Record<string, string[]>; // `${path}:${line}` -> suggested comments
  cardSuggestions?: string[];
  omissionRationale?: string;
};

type DiffBlockRef = {
  path: string;
  label: string;
  role: 'primary' | 'related' | 'audit' | 'new-file';
  diff: UnifiedDiffSubset;
};

type CardReviewState = {
  status: 'pending' | 'liked' | 'disliked';
  lineComments: Array<{
    path: string;
    line: number;
    body: string;
  }>;
  cardComment?: string;
};
```

## Changeset model

V1 should review any two SHAs, defaulting to PR base..head when launched from a PR. Avoid coupling core logic to GitHub-specific concepts. GitHub/GitLab/etc. should be adapters for fetching PR metadata and exporting final review comments.

Launch points and surfaces:

1. Button in the Git Status Widget. It should pass branch/PR metadata plus insertion, deletion, and file-count stats into the changeset model.
2. Popover/action on GitHub PR links in chat history, preserving PR URL/number/title metadata for header and toolbar links.
3. `/walkthrough-pr <url|number>` skill.
4. Side-panel toolbar actions for fullscreen/wide review and opening the same walkthrough in a standalone `/walkthrough?...` browser tab.

## LLM responsibilities

- Build orientation summary.
- Group raw diff into logical cards.
- Classify cards into phases.
- Choose primary and related diff blocks per card.
- Suggest line-level comments where concerns are directly anchorable.
- Suggest card-level comments for broader concerns.
- Detect omissions using a two-pass approach:
  1. Expected artefacts pass — tests, docs, migrations, feature flags, telemetry, error paths, etc.
  2. Verification pass — search diff and repo HEAD before flagging as absent.
- Build phase 4 audit summary from remaining/unreviewed lines.

## MVP constraints

- The checked-in prototype is the target UX and source of truth unless a deviation is explicitly reviewed and accepted. Fixture data is acceptable, but the production slice must still look and behave substantially like the prototype.
- Server-side generation can come later; first production slice can use mocked/fixture card data if needed to validate UI.
- The UI should live as a first-class preview/side-panel surface, not as cards embedded in chat messages.
- It must be usable at half-width alongside chat.
- It must support inline comments before external review export exists.
- The final output should be an internal draft review model first; GitHub export can be an adapter.
- Audit must remain a normal review card with diff blocks and comments, not only a summary screen.

## Prototype notes from session

Final prototype decisions:

- The prototype is the normative UX target for this feature. Implementation review should compare against `pr-walkthrough-panel-prototype.html`, not only against this prose checklist.
- Removed internal prompt/composer because outer Bobbit chat owns questions.
- Collapsed rail uses visible phase pips plus clickable card-dot substeps.
- Full width defaults side-by-side; narrow defaults inline, but user may choose side-by-side.
- Side-by-side diff overflow uses a single widget-level horizontal scrollbar.
- Side-by-side rows expose comments, suggestions, and editors on both old and new sides of paired rows.
- Like uses primary button styling.
- Dislike is neutral at rest and red on hover/focus.
- The prototype used realistic PR #637 content:
  - lazy wrappers around `@earendil-works/pi-ai`, qrcode, JSZip, highlight.js.
  - `PLACEHOLDER_DEFAULT_MODEL` in `remote-agent.ts`.
  - type-only `ui/index.ts` re-exports.
  - `manualChunks` in `vite.config.ts`.
  - tightened `tests/bundle-size.test.ts` budgets.
  - omission: no user-flow E2E for first lazy-load activation.
  - audit warning examples: `vite.profile.config.ts`, `pill-overflow-promotion.spec.ts` timeout bump.
