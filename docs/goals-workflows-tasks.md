# Goals, Workflows, Tasks & Gates

This document explains how Bobbit's goal orchestration system works — how goals, workflows, tasks, and gates relate to each other, and how context flows between agents.

## Concepts

### Goals

A **goal** is a unit of work with a title, spec (markdown), working directory, and state (`todo` | `in-progress` | `complete` | `shelved`). Every goal is scoped to a registered project via its `projectId` field (see [internals.md — Multi-project architecture](internals.md#multi-project-architecture)). Worktrees are created relative to that project's `rootPath`.

`POST /api/goals` requires the caller to identify the project: either an explicit `projectId` in the request body, or a `cwd` inside a registered project's `rootPath`. There is no default-project fallback — a request with neither resolvable returns **400**. See the [Project resolution contract](rest-api.md#project-resolution-contract) in the REST API docs for the exact error shape.

Goals can run in **team mode**, where a Team Lead agent orchestrates multiple role agents (coders, reviewers, testers) working concurrently in their own worktrees. Goals carry an `autoStartTeam` flag (defaults to `true`). When enabled, the server automatically calls `teamManager.startTeam()` after worktree setup completes — no manual "Start Team" click needed. If auto-start fails but the worktree succeeded, the error is logged and the worktree remains usable; the user can start the team manually. The retry-setup handler also respects this flag.

### Workflows

A **workflow** is a reusable template that defines which gates a goal must pass, their dependency relationships (a DAG), and verification configs. Workflows live **inline in `project.yaml::workflows`** — the project assistant generates a bespoke block per project from [defaults/workflow-authoring-guide.md](../defaults/workflow-authoring-guide.md). The MD authoring guide is the single source of truth for workflow patterns; the runtime never reads it.

Workflows are **project-scoped only** — there is no system-scope or builtin layer and no config cascade. New projects do **not** receive any default seed; the project assistant designs workflows from the discovered components and commands, and a project may legitimately persist with zero workflows. Every step references project-specific `(component, command)` pairs that have no meaning outside the owning project, so cascading would be ceremony around an empty upper layer. See [internals.md — Workflows are project-scoped only](internals.md#workflows-are-project-scoped-only) and [No default workflow scaffold](internals.md#no-default-workflow-scaffold).

When a goal is created with a `workflowId`, the entire workflow is **snapshotted** into `PersistedGoal.workflow`. This frozen copy is immune to later template edits — the goal's requirements are locked at creation time.

Goals without workflows still work fine — workflows are optional **at the data-model layer**. However, the standard goal-creation flow (the +New Goal picker and the goal assistant) requires the linked project to have at least one workflow. See [Default workflow resolution](#default-workflow-resolution) below for the resolution rules and the empty-workflows UX.

#### Default workflow resolution

Goal creation never assumes a workflow named `"general"` exists. The default-workflow rule, applied both server-side (`GoalManager.createGoal`) and UI-side (the goal preview panel and proposal toast), is:

1. **Explicit `workflowId` supplied** — used as-is. If the id doesn't resolve in the project's `WorkflowStore`, the request fails with `Workflow not found: <id>`.
2. **No `workflowId` supplied** — the server falls back to **the first workflow in `workflowStore.getAll()`**. Order is the store's insertion order, which preserves the project-config cascade priority (project > user > defaults). The UI mirrors this: the workflow `<select>` is seeded to the first available id once `fetchWorkflows` resolves.
3. **No workflows at all** — `createGoal` throws `NO_WORKFLOWS_MSG` ("This project has no workflows configured…"). The UI never reaches submit in this state because the empty-workflows banner disables the Accept button (see below).

No source file outside seed data, tests, and documentation may use the literal string `"general"` as a workflow default. This is enforced by the pinning test [`tests/no-general-workflow-default.test.ts`](../tests/no-general-workflow-default.test.ts), which scans `src/server/agent/` and `src/app/` for the string and rejects new occurrences (the role named `"general"` is explicitly allowlisted; it is unrelated to workflows). The pin exists because `"general"` was historically a magic default hardcoded in five places — UI dropdown initial state, accept handler fallback, `GoalManager` lookup, the goal-assistant prompt, and the re-attempt context builder — but workflows are now project-scoped with no system-level builtins, so there is no guarantee any given project has a workflow with that id. Hardcoding the string produced confusing `Workflow not found: general` errors on projects whose assistant had generated a bespoke workflow set with different names. The fix routes everything through "first workflow in store" instead, with the pinning test preventing reintroduction. See [Workflows](#workflows) for why workflows are project-scoped.

#### Goal creation in a zero-workflow project

Projects can legitimately exist with zero workflows (e.g. a freshly registered project whose assistant has not yet run). The goal-creation UX in that state:

- **Goal preview panel** (the +New Goal picker and the goal-assistant accept panel) renders an **empty-workflows banner** with a brief explanation and an **Open Project Assistant** button. The button calls `createProjectAssistantSession(project.rootPath, …)` from `src/app/dialogs.ts`, passing the linked project's id and existing name. The Accept button is disabled while the banner is visible, with a tooltip explaining why.
- **While workflows are still loading** for the linked project, the panel shows a skeleton placeholder instead of either the dropdown or the banner. This prevents the banner from flickering on initial load before `ensureWorkflowsLoaded(projectId)` resolves.
- **Goal assistant LLM** receives a stern sentinel from `SessionManager._buildWorkflowList()` when the project has no workflows: an instruction *not* to call `propose_goal` and to surface the empty state to the user. The assistant's normal "pick the first listed workflow" guidance only applies when at least one workflow is present.

The per-project workflow availability is cached client-side (`_workflowCacheByProject` in `src/app/render.ts`) so switching back to a project that has workflows does not refetch unnecessarily. Browser E2E coverage lives in [`tests/e2e/ui/goal-empty-workflows-banner.spec.ts`](../tests/e2e/ui/goal-empty-workflows-banner.spec.ts).

To author workflows for a project, see [defaults/workflow-authoring-guide.md](../defaults/workflow-authoring-guide.md) and run the project assistant from Settings → Components.

#### `createGoal` failure preserves the assistant

The goal-assistant accept flow (both the goal-preview panel handler and the `propose_goal` proposal-toast handler in `src/app/render.ts`) awaits `POST /api/goals` **before** tearing down any state. Disconnecting the remote agent, clearing the active assistant view, deleting the persisted draft, removing `gateway.sessionId`, and navigating to the goal dashboard all happen only on success.

On failure (any rejection from `createGoal`), the assistant session, chat history, draft, `gatewaySessions` entry, and form state are left intact. The standard `showConnectionError("Failed to create goal", …)` toast surfaces the error message — the user can edit the proposal (e.g. pick a different workflow, fix the title) and click Accept again, or ask the assistant to revise. This avoids the prior failure mode where a 400 response (typically `Workflow not found: …` or `NO_WORKFLOWS_MSG`) would dismiss the assistant and force the user to start over with no context. Re-attempt sessions (with `reattemptGoalId`) go through the same accept handler and benefit from the same guarantee. Browser E2E coverage lives in [`tests/e2e/ui/goal-accept-failure-keeps-assistant.spec.ts`](../tests/e2e/ui/goal-accept-failure-keeps-assistant.spec.ts).

#### Validating a proposed workflow at proposal time

The goal assistant emits a goal via the `propose_goal` tool, which names a `workflow` ID and optional `options` (comma-separated optional-step names). Because the assistant's prompt is seeded with the project's workflow list at session-creation time, that list can go stale — a project's workflows may be renamed or removed after the session started — and an LLM can hallucinate IDs outright. **Why this matters:** without validation a stale or invented workflow silently produces a broken proposal that only fails much later at goal-creation submit, by which point the assistant has already torn down its rationale. Worse, the `propose_goal` tool used to swallow the rejection and report a false `"Proposal submitted"` ack, so the agent never learned it needed to correct itself.

Validation now happens **at seed time**, the moment the proposal is written. The `POST /api/sessions/:id/proposal/goal/seed` handler (which the tool calls to persist the draft) resolves the session's project workflows — mirroring goal creation: `configCascade.resolveWorkflows(projectId)`, falling back to the project context `workflowStore` — and runs `validateGoalProposalWorkflow()` **before** writing the file, so an invalid workflow never produces a draft at all.

Rejections are structured `400` JSON so the agent can self-correct:

- **`UNKNOWN_WORKFLOW`** — `workflow` is explicitly named but is not a configured workflow ID. The body carries `availableWorkflows: [{id, name}]` and a `message` listing the valid IDs.
- **`UNKNOWN_OPTIONAL_STEP`** — one or more `options` names don't match an optional step of the chosen workflow. The body carries `validOptionalSteps: string[]` and a `message` listing them. Optional steps are matched **only by the canonical `step.name`** of `verify` steps with `optional: true` — the same identifier the verification runtime (`verification-logic.ts`) and the goal-creation UI key on (see [Optional verify steps](#optional-verify-steps)). Accepting an `optionalLabel`/`label` here would be a false success that later fails to enable the step. When `workflow` is omitted, `options` are validated against the project's default (first) workflow, consistent with [Default workflow resolution](#default-workflow-resolution).

**Validation is skipped** (no error) when:

- The session has no resolvable `projectId` — workflows can't be resolved, so there is nothing to check.
- The project has **zero workflows** — the empty-workflows state is preserved (see [Goal creation in a zero-workflow project](#goal-creation-in-a-zero-workflow-project)); the UI dropdown supplies a default.
- `workflow` is **empty or omitted** — not an error; the UI dropdown supplies the default, so only explicitly-named unknown IDs are rejected.

On the tool side, `propose_goal` (in `defaults/tools/proposals/extension.ts`) surfaces a seed rejection as an `isError` tool result whose text is the server's `message` — including the available-workflow list or valid optional-step names — so the agent sees the correction it needs. The other `propose_*` tools keep their log-and-ack behaviour; only `propose_goal` validates a workflow. The happy-path ack and the `__proposal_rev_v1__:<rev>` success contract are unchanged. Coverage: [`tests/e2e/proposal-goal-workflow-validation.spec.ts`](../tests/e2e/proposal-goal-workflow-validation.spec.ts) (API) and [`tests/proposal-tools-goal-validation.test.ts`](../tests/proposal-tools-goal-validation.test.ts) (tool-level).

#### Phantom workflow IDs in the proposal panel

A second failure mode lived in the proposal panel's workflow `<select>` (`src/app/proposal-panels.ts`). The dropdown binds its value to the proposed workflow ID. When that ID isn't among the project's loaded workflows, no `<option>` matches, so the browser visually falls back to the first option while the form state still holds the **phantom** (not-in-list) value. Re-selecting the displayed option fires no `change` event, so the phantom persists and Create submits the invalid workflow — the dropdown appears to "have no effect."

The fix is `normalizeWorkflowSelections()`: once the workflow list is loaded, any empty or phantom selection is reset to the first available ID so the rendered option and the underlying state always agree. A value already present in the list is never clobbered. It runs from the cached and async paths of `ensureWorkflowsLoaded`, from `syncProposalFormState()` (the inline goal-proposal panel's `_proposalWorkflowId`), and from `setSelectedWorkflowId()` (the assistant preview panel's `_selectedWorkflowId`). Because workflows load asynchronously, the post-load pass is the safety net for a phantom ID present before the list arrived; stale async loads for a project the user has navigated away from never clobber the active selection. Browser E2E for both panels: [`tests/e2e/ui/goal-proposal-invalid-workflow.spec.ts`](../tests/e2e/ui/goal-proposal-invalid-workflow.spec.ts).

**Removed runtime concepts:**

- `.bobbit/config/workflows/<id>.yaml` is no longer read at runtime. The first-boot migration in `migrate-project-yaml.ts` folds any pre-existing files into the inline `workflows:` block and removes the directory.
- `defaults/workflows/*.yaml` no longer exists. There is no shipped-builtins location for workflows; `BuiltinConfigProvider.getWorkflows()` returns `[]`. The project assistant generates project-specific workflows from the MD guide on creation. See [No default workflow scaffold](internals.md#no-default-workflow-scaffold).

#### Workflow data model

```typescript
interface VerifyStep {
  name: string;
  type: "command" | "llm-review" | "agent-qa" | "human-signoff";
  // For type: "command" — three exclusive shapes:
  component?: string; // Component name to resolve against components[]
  command?: string;   // Named command on that component (component.commands[command])
  run?: string;       // Free-form shell. May coexist with component (uses component cwd) or stand alone.
  // For type: "llm-review" / "agent-qa":
  prompt?: string;    // Review/QA prompt body (runtime tokens substituted by gate runner)
  role?: string;      // Reviewer role to spawn
  expect?: "success" | "failure";
  timeout?: number;
  phase?: number;     // Execution phase (default 0). See "Phased verification" below.
  optional?: boolean; // If true, step runs only when enabled per-goal. See "Optional verify steps".
  optionalLabel?: string; // Human-readable label for the goal-creation toggle.
  label?: string;     // Human-signoff card title only (type: "human-signoff").
  description?: string; // Tooltip text shown as ⓘ icon next to the toggle. For agent-qa steps, overridden when no component has config.qa_start_command set.
}

interface WorkflowGate {
  id: string;              // Unique within this workflow, e.g. "design-doc"
  name: string;            // Display name
  dependsOn: string[];     // Other gate IDs within THIS workflow (the DAG)
  content?: boolean;       // Whether this gate accepts markdown content
  injectDownstream?: boolean; // Whether passed content is injected into downstream agents
  metadata?: Record<string, string>; // Key-value metadata schema
  optional?: boolean;      // If true, team lead may signal with "N/A" (still must be signaled)
  manual?: boolean;        // If true, gate has no automated verify — user clicks "Mark passed" when ready
  verify?: VerifyStep[];   // Verification steps to run on signal
}

interface Workflow {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  gates: WorkflowGate[];
  createdAt: number;
  updatedAt: number;
}
```

#### Inline workflow YAML format

Workflows live inside `project.yaml` under the top-level `workflows:` block (one entry per id). For `type: command` steps, three step shapes are accepted; there is **no `cwd:` field** on any step — working directory is structurally derived from the component, or it is the per-branch container root.

| Step shape | Working directory | Command source |
|---|---|---|
| `{ component, command }` | `<branch-container>/<component.repo>/<component.relative_path>` | `components[component].commands[command]` |
| `{ component, run }` | same as above | literal `run` string |
| `{ run }` | `<branch-container>` (per-branch worktree set root) | literal `run` string |

```yaml
# project.yaml excerpt
components:
  - name: myapp
    repo: "."
    commands: { build: npm run build, check: npm run check, test: npm test }

workflows:
  general:
    name: General
    description: Lightweight workflow for general-purpose goals.
    gates:
      - id: design-doc
        name: Design Document
        content: true
        inject_downstream: true
        verify:
          - { name: "Design review", type: llm-review, role: architect, prompt: "Review this design document." }

      - id: implementation
        name: Implementation
        depends_on: [design-doc]
        verify:
          # Component-linked, named command — resolves to components.myapp.commands.build:
          - { name: "Build myapp", type: command, component: "myapp", command: "build" }
          # Component-linked, free-form shell (cwd derived from component):
          - { name: "Custom thing", type: command, component: "myapp", run: "./scripts/special.sh" }
          - { name: "Code review", type: llm-review, phase: 1, prompt: "Review the changes on {{branch}} vs origin/{{baseBranch}}." }

      - id: ready-to-merge
        name: Ready to Merge
        depends_on: [implementation]
        verify:
          # Pure free-form (cwd = per-branch container root):
          - { name: "Branch pushed", type: command, run: "git push origin {{branch}}:refs/heads/{{branch}} && git ls-remote --heads origin {{branch}} | grep -q ." }
```

**Why structural references.** Editing `components[name].commands[name]` updates every workflow step that references it — no regeneration required for command edits. Validation at load time catches typos and stale references (component renamed, command removed) before the agent runs anything. Cleaner audit trail in gate output: shows the `(component, command)` pair, not just a literal shell string.

**Validator rejects** at workflow-load time:

- `type: command` with `command:` but no `component:`
- `type: command` with both `command:` and `run:`
- `component:` referencing an unknown component name
- a `(component, command)` pair where the component has no such command name

The validator does **not** reject template tokens in free-form `run:` or `prompt:` strings. Runtime context tokens (`{{branch}}`, `{{baseBranch}}`, `{{goal_spec}}`, `{{goal_title}}`, etc. — `{{master}}` is still accepted as a legacy alias) are necessary for workflows to function and are substituted by the gate runner before each step executes. Any other tokens (e.g. a stale `{{project.foo}}` left from a hand edit) just pass through to the shell as literal strings and fail at runtime the same way any other typo would.

#### Workflow editor authoring

Settings → Workflows exposes the same schema as inline workflow YAML. Authors can edit gate `id`, `name`, `dependsOn`, `content`, `injectDownstream`, `optional`, `manual`, and `metadata`; verification step `type`, command/run source, prompt, role, component, timeout, phase, description, optional toggle, and `optionalLabel`; and `human-signoff`-specific `label` and `prompt` fields.

The editor validates the same user-facing constraints before save: `human-signoff` steps require a card title and prompt; named `command` steps require a component; and stale hidden fields are stripped when a step changes type so saved workflows use the canonical YAML shape.

#### Dependency DAG

Each gate's `dependsOn` lists sibling gate IDs that must pass before it can be signaled. An empty list is explicit and valid: it makes the gate an independent root/parallel gate. The workflow editor preserves `dependsOn: []` instead of silently converting it into a dependency on the previous gate.

This serves two purposes:

1. **Signal gating** — the server returns 409 if you try to signal a gate before its dependencies have passed.
2. **Context injection** — when an agent is spawned to produce work for a gate, the passed content of upstream gates is automatically injected into the agent's system prompt.

### Gate states

Each gate has a status: `pending`, `passed`, `failed`, or `bypassed`.

- **`pending`** — initial state; the gate has not been signaled, or was reset after an upstream re-signal or explicit reset.
- **`passed`** — the gate was signaled and all verification steps succeeded (or no verification was defined).
- **`failed`** — the gate was signaled but verification failed.
- **`bypassed`** — a human overseer forced the gate past verification without the work passing. It is deliberately a distinct state from `passed` so the override is auditable and visually obvious. See [Human gate bypass](#human-gate-bypass).

When a previously-passed gate is re-signaled, all transitive downstream gates are cascade-reset to `pending`.

### Per-gate actions in the goal status widget

The chat-header `<goal-status-widget>` is the compact workflow surface for the current goal. Its popover lists every gate. The actions shown on a row depend on its status:

- **View** (`passed` rows only) — opens the goal dashboard Gates tab for that gate and expands the gate detail section.
- **Reset** (`passed` rows only) — asks for confirmation, then clears the selected gate and downstream dependent gates back to `pending`.
- **Bypass** (`pending` and `failed` rows only) — the human-only override that forces the gate to the `bypassed` state. It is never shown on `passed`, `running`, or already-`bypassed` rows. See [Human gate bypass](#human-gate-bypass).

So `passed` rows show View/Reset, `pending`/`failed` rows show Bypass, and `running` rows show no actions. This keeps View/Reset focused on completed approvals that can be inspected or invalidated, while exposing the bypass override only where it is meaningful.

#### Dashboard focus route

The View action navigates with hash-query state so browser Back and reload can restore the focused gate:

```text
#/goal/<goalId>?tab=gates&gate=<gateId>&signal=<signalId|latest-passed>
```

The dashboard reads `tab`, `gate`, and `signal` from the route. It switches to the Gates tab, expands the gate row, highlights it briefly, scrolls it into view, and expands/focuses the requested signal entry. `signal=latest-passed` is a convenience token used when the caller does not already know the concrete latest passed signal; after gate data loads, the dashboard replaces it with the resolved signal id when possible.

Manual gate or signal expansion on the dashboard updates the same route state. This makes focused dashboard views shareable and resilient enough for reload/back navigation without introducing separate UI state storage.

#### Reset invalidation semantics

`POST /api/goals/:id/gates/:gateId/reset` resets the selected gate plus every transitive downstream dependent discovered from the workflow DAG (`dependsOn`), not from display order. Independent gates are untouched.

Each affected `GateState` also receives `verificationCacheInvalidatedAt`, set to the reset timestamp. Verification cache selection treats that timestamp as a boundary: passed step results from signals at or before the marker are ineligible for same-commit reuse, while later signals remain eligible. This makes the next post-reset signal run active verification steps normally even when the commit SHA is unchanged.

Reset is safe to repeat:

- gates already `pending` stay pending and are reported as unchanged;
- failed downstream gates are also reset to `pending`, because their result may have depended on the invalidated upstream output;
- active verifications for any affected gate are cancelled before statuses are rewritten;
- verification-step cache eligibility is invalidated for both changed and already-pending affected gates;
- only gates whose stored status actually changes are counted in `changedGateIds`.

The endpoint broadcasts `gate_status_changed` for affected gates and a `gate_reset` summary event so the status widget, sidebar badge, dashboard pipeline, and team lead view refresh promptly.

#### History and audit preservation

Reset invalidates the current pass state and old cache eligibility; it does **not** delete audit data. Gate signal history, verification output, content, content version, and metadata remain in the gate store. Consumers must treat `status` as the source of truth for whether preserved content is currently approved. In other words, a reset gate may still have historical content attached, but downstream context injection and user trust decisions should require the gate to be `passed` again.

`human-signoff` steps are never reused from cache, regardless of reset state. Prior human approvals stay inspectable in signal history, but every re-signal must obtain a fresh human decision.

After a fresh post-reset signal passes, normal cache behavior resumes from that new signal forward: later non-reset re-signals at the same commit may reuse the post-reset passed step output and show `[cached from prior signal]` for reused non-human steps.

#### Team lead notification

After a reset, Bobbit sends the team lead session a system-origin message when a live team lead exists. The message names:

- the selected gate that was reset;
- downstream dependent gates invalidated by the DAG traversal;
- which gates had passed state cleared;
- which affected gates were already not passed;
- why downstream implementation, review, or verification work may need to be revisited.

If the team lead is streaming, the server delivers the notice as a live steer; otherwise it queues it as a steered prompt. The reset response includes `teamLeadNotified` so callers can tell whether a live lead received the message. Goals without an active team lead still reset normally.

#### Usage and test coverage

Use Reset when an approved upstream artifact is no longer trustworthy and downstream work may have been built on it. Use a new gate signal instead when the gate has fresh replacement evidence ready to verify immediately.

Coverage lives in:

- [`tests/gate-store-logic.test.ts`](../tests/gate-store-logic.test.ts) — gate-store reset and dependency behavior.
- [`tests/e2e/gate-reset-api.spec.ts`](../tests/e2e/gate-reset-api.spec.ts) — DAG invalidation, idempotency, preserved history/content, active verification cancellation, sandbox denial, team lead notification.
- [`tests/e2e/ui/goal-status-widget.spec.ts`](../tests/e2e/ui/goal-status-widget.spec.ts) — passed-gate View/Reset controls, dashboard focus route reload/back behavior, confirmation guard, widget/sidebar/dashboard refresh, and team lead message visibility.

### Human gate bypass

A gate can be **bypassed**: a human overseer forces it past verification when an agent reports that a verification step is genuinely impossible to satisfy (for example, a check that cannot pass in the current environment, or a requirement that has been overtaken by a deliberate scope decision). Bypass exists so a goal is not permanently stuck behind a gate that no amount of agent work can clear — while keeping the escape hatch firmly in human hands.

#### Why this is human-only, and how that is enforced

The whole point of a gate is to stop low-quality or unverified work from flowing downstream. If an agent could clear its own gate, the gate would be worthless. Bypass is therefore an **honesty-system override reserved for the human overseer** — consistent with the rest of the gate UI, which trusts the gateway token rather than modeling per-user identity.

This is defended in two layers, in order of importance:

1. **Non-advertisement (primary).** The bypass capability is *never* exposed to agents. There is no MCP/agent tool for it, and it is never mentioned in any agent-facing prompt, tool description, or injected context. An agent has no way to learn the capability exists from inside its own context.
2. **Runtime guard (backstop).** The bypass endpoint requires `isInitiatedByHuman: true` in the request body and refuses anything else with a 400 explaining that bypass is for human use only. Sandbox-scoped agent tokens are rejected with 403 before the guard is even reached.

Because there is no identity model yet, the endpoint does not (and cannot) cryptographically prove a human sent the request. The trust model is honesty plus non-discoverability, not authentication. This is intentional and matches the existing reset / sign-off endpoints.

#### What a bypass records

Bypass is auditable like any other gate event. `POST /api/goals/:id/gates/:gateId/bypass` appends a **synthetic audit signal** to the gate's signal history (`sessionId: "human-bypass"`, `metadata.bypass: "true"`) capturing:

- **`whyBypassed`** — required free-text justification, persisted verbatim;
- **`whoAmI`** — required free-text label naming who performed the bypass (not verified — honesty system);
- **`bypassedAt`** — server timestamp.

The gate status is then set to `bypassed`, persisted, and a `gate_status_changed` event is broadcast on the goal WebSocket. The team lead session, if live, is notified with a system-origin message naming the gate, the `whoAmI` label, the reason, and a reminder that the goal still needs explicit human confirmation before it can complete. See [rest-api.md — Gate bypass endpoint](rest-api.md#gate-bypass-endpoint) for the full request/response contract and error matrix.

#### Dependency vs. completion semantics

A bypassed gate is treated differently depending on what is being decided:

- **Downstream dependency ordering — satisfied.** A bypassed upstream gate unblocks its dependents exactly as a passed gate would, so the rest of the workflow can proceed. Without this, bypassing one stuck gate would still leave everything behind it blocked, defeating the purpose.
- **Downstream context injection — NOT injected.** Only `passed` gates with `injectDownstream` inject their content into downstream agents' prompts. A bypassed gate has no verified content to stand behind, so nothing is injected. Dependents proceed, but they do not receive bypassed-gate content as trusted upstream context.
- **Goal completion — still blocked until a human confirms.** `team_complete` (the agent/MCP path) refuses to finish a goal that has any bypassed gate, with a distinct error (`Cannot complete: N gate(s) were bypassed and require human confirmation`). An agent therefore cannot auto-finish a goal that was only resolved via a human override.

#### Confirming completion despite bypassed gates

The explicit human path to finish such a goal is `POST /api/goals/:id/team/complete` with `{ confirmBypassedGates: true }`. This reuses the completion route's options (`completeTeam({ allowBypassedGates: true })`) rather than adding a separate endpoint. Like bypass itself, this confirmation is human-only: sandbox-scoped tokens are rejected with 403, so an agent cannot confirm its way past a bypass. In the UI a **Confirm completion** button appears only when bypassed gates exist.

#### Resetting a bypassed gate

Bypass is reversible. Resetting a bypassed gate (via the reset endpoint or the widget's Reset action) returns it to `pending` and clears it from the downstream/completion calculus, just like resetting a passed gate. The bypass audit signal remains in history for the record.

#### UI differentiation

The override is made visually unmistakable so a bypass is never mistaken for a clean pass:

- **Bypass button** — the `<goal-status-widget>` popover shows a destructive-styled **Bypass** action only on gates that have *not* yet passed (pending/failed rows). It is never offered on a passed or already-bypassed gate. Clicking it opens an inline form collecting `whyBypassed` (multi-line) and `whoAmI` (text), then calls the endpoint with `isInitiatedByHuman: true`; endpoint errors surface inline like the reset error row.
- **Per-gate icon** — a bypassed gate renders a red warning/exclamation triangle (distinct from the green check used for passed), with the `whoAmI` and `whyBypassed` available on the row.
- **Differentiated progress badge** — `renderGateProgressBadge` (the chat-header pill and the sidebar goal badge both call it) counts bypassed gates *toward the numerator* so a fully-resolved-via-bypass goal still reads `(4/4)`, **but turns the whole badge red and appends a trailing `!`** (e.g. red `(4/4)!`) to signal this is not a clean pass. The dropdown's header badge inherits the same treatment. The badge reads `bypassed` / `bypassedCount` from the cached `GateStatusSummary`.

#### Coverage

- [`tests/gate-dependency-enforcement.test.ts`](../tests/gate-dependency-enforcement.test.ts) — a bypassed upstream gate unblocks dependents like a passed one.
- [`tests/e2e/gate-bypass-api.spec.ts`](../tests/e2e/gate-bypass-api.spec.ts) — endpoint happy path, audit-signal persistence, broadcast, guard/validation errors, sandbox denial, reset-to-pending, and completion gating.
- [`tests/e2e/ui/gate-bypass.spec.ts`](../tests/e2e/ui/gate-bypass.spec.ts) — Bypass button visibility, why/who form submission, bypassed row state, red `(N/N)!` badge, and persistence across reload.

### Signaling a gate

Agents signal gates via the `gate_signal` tool (or `POST /api/goals/:id/gates/:gateId/signal`). A signal can include:

- **Content** — markdown text (for content gates like design docs)
- **Metadata** — key-value pairs (for metadata gates like test results)

Each signal is recorded in the gate's signal history with a unique ID, timestamp, and session reference.

**`gate_signal` is restricted to the team lead role at the tool-policy layer.** Every contributor role (`coder`, `test-engineer`, `reviewer`, `code-reviewer`, `security-reviewer`, `architect`, `spec-auditor`, `qa-tester`, `docs-writer`) declares `toolPolicies.gate_signal: never` in `defaults/roles/*.yaml`, so the tool-guard extension hard-blocks the call at runtime. Only the team lead has the goal branch checked out and can merge contributor work before verification runs from the goal-branch HEAD. Contributors hand off command-format / expect-failure gate inputs (raw shell command, `error_pattern` regex) via task `result_summary` for the team lead to attach when signalling. Invariant enforced by `tests/role-gate-signal-policy.test.ts`.

### Verification

Gates can define automated verification that runs when signaled:

- **Command** — runs shell commands, checks exit codes (e.g. `npm run check`)
- **LLM review** — spawns a sub-agent for qualitative review against a prompt
- **Agent QA** — spawns a test-engineer session that drives browser-based QA testing via the `/qa-test` skill
- **Human sign-off** — parks the gate on a deferred resolver until a person approves or rejects via the UI (see [Human sign-off steps](#human-sign-off-steps))
- **Combined** — mechanical + qualitative steps across phases

Verification is async. On signal, the verification status is `"running"`. On completion: the gate transitions to `"passed"` (all steps pass) or `"failed"` (any step fails, with details). A WebSocket event `gate_verification_complete` is emitted. If no verification is defined, the gate auto-passes.

#### Active verification snapshots

While verification is running, the gate store contains seeded step rows so history is never empty. Those rows are not authoritative for live progress: they may carry placeholder values before a step starts. Agent tools and UI surfaces therefore read a shared active snapshot that overlays the persisted signal with `VerificationHarness` state for the latest running signal.

`gate_status` and `gate_inspect section=verification` use the same snapshot, so they agree on step status, summary counts, durations, bounded output, and active metadata. Final completed signals still read from the persisted verification result.

Step `status` is explicit:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `passed` | Step completed successfully. |
| `failed` | Step completed unsuccessfully. |
| `skipped` | Step was intentionally skipped, such as a disabled optional step. |
| `running` | Step is executing now; duration is elapsed time so far. |
| `waiting` | Step has not started yet. This is also the API representation for "yet to run". |
| `blocked` | Step did not run because an earlier phase failed. |

For non-final `running`, `waiting`, and `blocked` states, callers should use `status` instead of treating `passed: false` as failure. `passed` is only meaningful on final `passed`, `failed`, or `skipped` steps.

Verification log output is bounded by default: `gate_status` and `gate_inspect section=verification` return the last 20 lines per step, not full logs. Agents that need deeper evidence should call `gate_inspect` with a targeted selection mode:

- `mode=tail&lines=N` for more trailing context;
- `mode=head&lines=N` for startup output;
- `mode=slice&from=A&to=B` for an exact line range;
- `mode=grep&pattern=...&context=N` for focused failure searches;
- `full` only when a broad read is needed. Normal line, byte, and tool-result caps still apply.

Running command steps can include live stdout/stderr tails. The server reads those log files with bounded byte limits before applying the same selection and aggregate response budgets used for persisted output.

##### Targeting a single verification step

A gate often runs several verify steps (e.g. type-check + lint + unit + e2e, or multiple review steps). By default `gate_inspect section=verification` returns *every* step, so a team lead chasing one failing step still receives all the others' output and cannot scope a `grep`/`slice` to the step they care about. The optional `step` parameter fixes that: pass the step **name** and the snapshot is scoped to just that one step.

- **Why by name:** step names are already surfaced to callers — `gate_status` returns the names of failed steps in `failedSteps`, and each step's `name` appears in an unfiltered verification snapshot. So the names needed to target a step are always in hand. Targeting is by name only; there is no index-based selector.
- **What changes:** `steps[]` contains only the matching step (still a single-element array, so the response shape is unchanged), and the selection mode (`grep`/`tail`/`slice`/`head`/`full`) applies to that one step's output. Per-step `selection` metadata and the default bounded-tail behavior are preserved.
- **Validation:** an unknown step name returns 400 listing the available step names for that signal. `step` is only meaningful for `section=verification`; combining it with `section=content` or `section=signals` returns 400 (`step is only valid with section='verification'`).

Typical triage flow: `gate_status` reports a failure and names the culprit in `failedSteps`, then `gate_inspect(section="verification", step="<name>", mode="grep", pattern="error|failed", context=2)` focuses the search on that step's log alone. See the [`gate_inspect` tool docs](../defaults/tools/tasks/gate_inspect.yaml) for the full parameter table.

The UI uses the same explicit-status model. Gate status cards, the `gate_inspect` renderer, and signaled gate live cards reconcile WebSocket events, active-verification fetches, and persisted signal rows without flickering back to placeholder failed or `0ms` states while verification is still running.

#### Gate verification baselines

A gate's **baseline** is the git reference the reviewer diffs `HEAD` against when deciding what to comment on. Choosing the right baseline matters: too broad and the reviewer critiques upstream work that another agent already merged; too narrow and real goal-branch changes slip through unreviewed. It is also the single biggest source of false-positive "branch doesn't match design doc" findings when it drifts.

Gate verification is **baseline-aware** — different gate kinds compare against different git references:

| Gate kind              | Baseline                                  | How it's detected                     |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Pre-implementation     | None — no diff is run                     | `content: true` AND no `depends_on` (see `isPreImplementationGate` in `src/server/agent/verification-logic.ts`) |
| Implementation & later | `origin/<primary>...HEAD`                 | All other verify-bearing gates        |
| `ready-to-merge`       | `origin/<primary>` via `git merge-base`   | Hardcoded in workflow YAML            |

**Why `origin/<primary>` and not local `<primary>`:** local refs are only as fresh as the last `git pull` on the host. Goal worktrees are created from `origin/<primary>`; verification must diff against the same anchor or it surfaces commits that have already been merged upstream as if they were goal-unique work. The harness runs `git fetch origin <primary>` before each review so `origin/<primary>` is current.

**Why pre-implementation gates skip the diff entirely:** a design-doc or issue-analysis gate, by workflow construction, runs before any code is committed. A branch with zero goal-unique commits is the normal expected state. Running a diff produces noise at best, and — if local `<primary>` is stale — false positives at worst. The reviewer prompt explicitly forbids `git diff` / `git log` for these gates.

**Primary branch detection:** the harness calls `detectPrimaryBranch(cwd)` from `src/server/skills/git.ts`, which uses `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` with a `master` → `main` fallback. Never hardcode `"master"` in new gate logic — always resolve via this helper. The resolved baseline (e.g. `origin/main@abc1234`) is printed into every review prompt's "Signal Context" so failures are trivial to diagnose.

**Configurable integration target (`base_ref`):** the project-level `base_ref` setting lets workflows track a different branch (e.g. `develop`, a release branch) as the integration target. New built-in/seeded workflows substitute `{{baseBranch}}` — the bare branch name derived from `base_ref` (or `detectPrimaryBranch()` when unset). `{{master}}` is intentionally unchanged and continues to resolve via `detectPrimaryBranch()` regardless of `base_ref`, so existing user-authored workflows keep their meaning. Write `origin/{{baseBranch}}` explicitly when a remote ref is needed. Full semantics, validation rules, and error inventory: [design/base-ref.md](design/base-ref.md).

**Branch publication safety:** Ready-to-Merge templates publish the goal branch with an explicit destination refspec:

```bash
git push origin {{branch}}:refs/heads/{{branch}}
```

Do not use bare forms such as `git push origin {{branch}}` in verification. Bare branch pushes can be redirected by inherited upstream config or `push.default=upstream` (for example, to `origin/master`). Bobbit-owned branch publication for goal/session/team worktrees uses the same rule (`<branch>:refs/heads/<branch>` or `HEAD:refs/heads/<branch>`), so `base_ref` controls baselines and status comparisons but never the remote push destination.

**Verification push guard:** before running any command step, the harness checks substituted shell text for unsafe `git push` invocations. From a non-primary goal/session branch it rejects pushes with no explicit refspec, bare branch refspecs, `--all`/`--mirror`, and explicit destinations that update the protected base/primary branch (`{{baseBranch}}`, `{{master}}`, or the primary fallback). The check also catches the wrapper forms covered by regression tests, such as absolute `git` executable paths and `env ... git push ...`. Safe publication to the current branch (`{{branch}}:refs/heads/{{branch}}`) is allowed.

**How the harness enforces this per-gate:** reviewer/architect/spec-auditor role YAMLs contain a `{{REVIEW_CONTEXT}}` placeholder in their preamble. `buildReviewPrompt()` in `src/server/agent/verification-harness.ts` substitutes it with either (a) an "implementation review" block containing the concrete `origin/<primary>...HEAD` diff instructions and the resolved baseline SHA, or (b) a "pre-implementation" notice that explicitly forbids `git diff` / `git log` and reminds the reviewer that zero goal-unique commits is the normal state. The branching decision uses `isPreImplementationGate()` on the signalled gate — role YAMLs never hardcode diff commands.

**Migration note for user-authored workflows:** `.bobbit/config/workflows/<id>.yaml` is no longer read at runtime. Pre-existing files there are folded into `project.yaml::workflows` on first boot by `migrate-project-yaml.ts` and the directory is removed. The harness resolves `{{master}}` to the dynamically-detected primary branch, but the `origin/` prefix is now injected only by built-in workflow content. User-authored prompts that still say `{{master}}...HEAD` (without `origin/`) will diff against the local ref — rewrite to `origin/{{master}}...HEAD` to get the full fix. Pre-implementation gates automatically benefit regardless, because that logic lives in the harness's review-prompt builder.

#### Phased verification

Verification steps have an optional `phase` field (integer, default 0). Steps are grouped by phase and phases execute **sequentially** in ascending order. Within each phase, steps run in **parallel** (preserving pre-phase behavior for phase-0 steps).

If any step in a phase fails, all subsequent phases are skipped immediately and the gate fails. Skipped steps are recorded with `skipped: true` on `GateSignalStep` and output `"Skipped — earlier phase failed"`. The `skipped` flag persists to disk so the UI can distinguish skipped steps from passed/failed ones after page reload.

This avoids wasting expensive LLM reviews (phase 1) when cheap command checks (phase 0) have already failed. In the built-in `feature` and `bug-fix` workflows, type-checking and tests run at phase 0, while code quality and security reviews run at phase 1.

```yaml
verify:
  - name: "Type check"
    type: command
    run: "npm run check"
    # phase: 0 (default — runs first)

  - name: "Unit tests"
    type: command
    run: "npm run test:unit"
    # phase: 0

  - name: "Code quality review"
    type: llm-review
    phase: 1              # Only runs if all phase-0 steps pass
    prompt: |
      Review for correctness, completeness, and code quality.
```

**Backward compatibility:** Steps without a `phase` field default to phase 0. Existing workflows and snapshotted goal workflows continue to work — all steps execute in parallel as before.

**WebSocket events:** The server broadcasts `gate_verification_phase_started` before each phase begins, including the phase number and which step indices belong to it. Step-level events (`gate_verification_step_started`, `gate_verification_step_complete`) include an optional `phase` field. The goal dashboard uses these to show phase progression in real time.

#### Verification step artifacts

Step results can carry an optional `artifact` containing rich content that would be too large or structured for the short `output` summary field.

```typescript
interface GateSignalStep {
  name: string;
  type: string;
  passed: boolean;
  skipped?: boolean;         // true when step was skipped (optional not enabled, or earlier phase failed)
  output: string;            // Short summary
  duration_ms: number;
  artifact?: {
    content: string;         // Full report body
    contentType: string;     // "text/markdown" | "text/html"
    metadata?: Record<string, string>;
  };
}
```

**LLM review artifacts:** When an `llm-review` step completes, the verification harness stores the reviewer's full analysis as a `text/markdown` artifact. The `output` field retains the short summary, while the artifact preserves the complete review text that was previously lost.

**Size limit:** Artifact content is capped at 10 MB. Content exceeding this limit is truncated.

**Dashboard rendering:** The goal dashboard renders artifacts based on their content type:
- **`text/markdown`** — shown inline in a collapsible "Full Review" section below the step result.
- **`text/html`** — a "View Report" button opens the HTML content in a new browser tab via a Blob URL.
- **Metadata** — if `artifact.metadata` is present, key-value pairs are displayed alongside the content.

#### Optional verify steps

Verify steps can be marked `optional: true` with a human-readable `optionalLabel` for the UI toggle. Optional steps are **disabled by default** — they only run when explicitly enabled for a specific goal. Steps can also include a `description` string, which renders as an ⓘ tooltip icon next to the toggle. For `agent-qa` steps, the toggle is automatically greyed out when no component in the project has `config.qa_start_command` set (driven by `isQaConfiguredOnAnyComponent()` via `GET /api/projects/:id/qa-testing-config`), and the tooltip is overridden with a configuration hint.

`label` is reserved for `type: human-signoff` card titles. Legacy optional non-human steps that used `label` are migrated to `optionalLabel` on load and written back in canonical shape on save.

**How it works:**
- Goals carry an `enabledOptionalSteps: string[]` field listing the `name` values of optional steps that should be active.
- At goal creation, the UI shows a checkbox for each optional step in the selected workflow. The goal assistant can pre-toggle steps via the `options` parameter (comma-separated step names) in its `propose_goal` tool call.
- During verification, the harness checks each step before phase grouping. If `step.optional === true` and the step's `name` is not in the goal's `enabledOptionalSteps`, the step is skipped with `{ passed: true, skipped: true, output: "Skipped — not enabled for this goal" }`.
- Skipped optional steps do not block the gate and do not affect phase pass/fail logic.

**Example in workflow YAML:**
```yaml
verify:
  - name: "Type check"
    type: command
    run: "npm run check"

  - name: "QA testing"
    type: agent-qa
    phase: 2
    optional: true
    optionalLabel: "Enable QA Testing"
    description: "Spawn a QA agent that builds the project, starts an ephemeral server, and drives a real browser through user scenarios."
    prompt: |
      You are performing QA testing for this goal...
```

#### `agent-qa` step type

The `agent-qa` verification step type spawns a test-engineer agent session that performs automated QA testing. It is designed for browser-based validation of user-facing changes, using the `/qa-test` skill to manage an ephemeral environment.

**How it works:**
1. The harness spawns a test-engineer session with the step's `prompt` (after variable substitution with `{{goal_spec}}`, `{{branch}}`, etc.) and upstream gate content injected as context.
2. The agent uses the `/qa-test` skill to stand up an ephemeral server, drive browser scenarios, and produce an HTML report.
3. The agent calls the `verification_result` tool to deliver structured results: verdict (pass/fail), summary, and optional HTML report.
4. If the agent includes `report_html`, the HTML is stored as the step's artifact with `contentType: "text/html"`.
5. If the agent goes idle without calling the tool, the harness sends a reminder prompt. If idle again, the step fails.

**Timeout:** Reads `qa_max_duration_minutes` from the owning component's `config:` map (default 10) plus a 5-minute buffer for setup/teardown. The verification harness resolves the component name via the step's `component:` field, falling back to the first component with `config.qa_start_command`, then a name-match against the project. See [docs/qa-testing.md](qa-testing.md) for the full per-component config layout.

**Retry logic:** Up to 3 attempts with backoff on transient failures (same pattern as `llm-review`).

**Test environments:** Respects `BOBBIT_LLM_REVIEW_SKIP` — when set, `agent-qa` steps auto-pass without spawning an agent.

**Resume support:** If the server restarts during an `agent-qa` step, the harness re-executes the step from scratch on the next verification cycle.

The `agent-qa` step typically runs at phase 2 in the `feature` and `bug-fix` workflows — after command checks (phase 0) and LLM reviews (phase 1) have passed. See [QA Testing](qa-testing.md) for project configuration and the `/qa-test` skill protocol.

#### Human sign-off steps

A `human-signoff` verification step parks the gate on a deferred resolver until a human approves or rejects it via the UI. It reuses the same async-verification machinery as `llm-review` and `agent-qa` — the only difference is *who* resolves the await: a REST submission from the browser rather than a reviewer agent's `verification_result` call.

**Why it exists.** Some gates need an authoritative human decision — a design review, a release sign-off, a security exception — without coupling the decision to the team lead's liveness or context-window budget. A dedicated step type keeps approval state on the verification record (restart-safe, cancellable, persisted) and emits the same `{ passed, output, artifact }` shape every other step produces, so failed sign-off feedback flows back through the team lead's normal "consume failed reviewer findings" path.

**YAML shape:**

```yaml
verify:
  - name: design-approval
    type: human-signoff
    phase: 1
    label: "Approve design doc"
    prompt: |
      Review the design doc for {{branch}} and approve or reject.
```

Both `label` and `prompt` are required (the validator rejects the step on load otherwise). `{{branch}}`, `{{baseBranch}}`, `{{goal_spec}}`, and `{{<gate>.meta.<key>}}` tokens (`{{master}}` remains valid as a legacy alias) are substituted before the prompt is shown to the user — same machinery as the other step types.

**Lifecycle.** When the harness reaches the step it broadcasts `gate_verification_awaiting_human` (see [websocket-protocol.md](websocket-protocol.md)), sets `awaitingHuman: true` on the active step, persists, and `await`s a deferred resolver. The chat-header `<goal-status-widget>` (mounted on any session with a goal id) surfaces the pending request and its **View content** action opens the submitted gate content in the review pane. The review pane owns inline comments, final comment, Approve / Reject validation, and decision submission. The browser POSTs to `/api/goals/:id/gates/:gateId/signoff` with `{ signalId, stepName, decision, feedback? }`; the harness builds a step result (passed = `decision === "pass"`; `output` and a `text/markdown` artifact carry the composed final/inline feedback when present) and the gate completes through the standard phase machinery. See [Review Pane Sign-Off](review-pane-signoff.md) for the review-source model, validation rules, persistence, and sanitization constraints.

**Resume / cancellation.**

- Server restart re-broadcasts `gate_verification_awaiting_human` from the resume path; the persisted `humanPrompt` / `humanLabel` survive intact. No data loss, no duplicate UI prompt — the widget reconciles by `(signalId, stepName)`.
- Re-signaling the gate while a sign-off is pending drains the resolver with `{ cancelled: true }`; the failed step result is suppressed and the fresh signal opens a new request.
- `POST /signoff` is idempotent — already-resolved or cancelled steps respond `409 { error: "step is no longer awaiting human input", status }`.

**Authz (v1).** Trusts the gateway token — anyone with UI access can sign off. Bobbit has no user-identity model today; submission records only a server-side timestamp. Sandboxed sub-agents are blocked from POSTing to `/signoff` at the `sandbox-guard` layer so a sandboxed agent cannot self-approve a sign-off step that gates its own work.

**Test bypass.** Only `BOBBIT_HUMAN_SIGNOFF_SKIP=1` auto-passes the step. There is **no** fallback to `BOBBIT_LLM_REVIEW_SKIP`: a "human" gate must not share a bypass with `agent-qa` / `llm-review`, otherwise the global E2E harness (which sets `BOBBIT_LLM_REVIEW_SKIP=1`) would silently auto-approve every human gate. With `BOBBIT_HUMAN_SIGNOFF_SKIP` unset or `=0`, the step parks awaiting a real human decision.

Feature behavior: [Review Pane Sign-Off](review-pane-signoff.md). Full design: [design/human-signoff-gates.md](design/human-signoff-gates.md). UI-side notification rules: [design/notification-policy.md](design/notification-policy.md).

### Gate Re-Signal Cancellation

When a gate is re-signaled while a previous verification is still running:
- The in-flight verification is cancelled — its reviewer sessions are terminated and its results are suppressed
- The cancelled signal's verification status is persisted as `"failed"` in the gate store
- Only the latest signal's verification determines the gate's pass/fail status
- The team lead is not notified about superseded verification results
- Command steps that are already running will complete but their results won't update gate status

This prevents reviewer agent proliferation when gates are re-signaled multiple times. The cancellation is triggered by `cancelStaleVerifications()` in `verification-harness.ts`, which is called before starting a new verification in the gate signal handler.

**Zombie detection:** If the previous verification's reviewer sessions have all died (crashed, timed out), the server detects this via `areVerificationSessionsAlive()` and auto-cancels the zombie verification instead of returning a 409 duplicate error. This prevents deadlocks where a stuck verification blocks all future signals.

**Manual cancellation:** A stuck verification can also be cancelled via `POST /api/goals/:goalId/gates/:gateId/cancel-verification`. The goal dashboard shows a Cancel button in the signal entry header when a verification is in "running" state. The endpoint is idempotent — calling it when nothing is running returns `{ cancelled: false }`.

### Tasks

**Tasks** are the operational work items within a goal. They track what needs to be done, who's doing it, and what state it's in.

Tasks have a state machine: `todo` → `in-progress` → `complete` | `skipped` | `blocked`.

Tasks can declare:
- **`dependsOn`** — other task IDs that must complete first (advisory, not enforced)
- **`workflowGateId`** — which workflow gate this task should produce output for
- **`inputGateIds`** — which workflow gate IDs to inject as context when prompting the assigned agent

#### Git handoff fields

Tasks carry structured git fields that enable local-only merges between agents, eliminating the need for PR-based inter-agent handoffs:

- **`baseSha`** — the commit the agent started from. Auto-populated by the system when a task is assigned to a spawned agent (resolved from `git rev-parse HEAD` in the agent's worktree).
- **`headSha`** — the tip of the agent's finished work. Set by the agent on completion via `task_update(head_sha="...")`.
- **`branch`** — the agent's working branch name. Auto-populated by the system from the `TeamAgent` record when a task is assigned.

These fields replace the old `commitSha` field, which was a single optional field with ambiguous semantics. The `baseSha` + `headSha` pair precisely defines the agent's changeset, and `branch` gives the team lead a direct local ref to merge from.

**Why local merges?** Agents work in co-located git worktrees on the same machine. Routing merges through origin (via PRs) added latency, created orphaned PRs, and introduced a fragile parsing step where the team lead had to extract branch names from free-text summaries. Local merges are instant and deterministic.

#### Git handoff lifecycle

| When | Who | What |
|------|-----|------|
| `team_spawn` | System | Auto-populates `baseSha` (HEAD at spawn) and `branch` (agent's branch name) on the `TeamAgent` record |
| Task assignment | System | Copies `baseSha` and `branch` from the `TeamAgent` to the assigned task |
| Agent works | Agent | Commits normally on its branch |
| Agent finishes | Agent | `task_update(state="complete", head_sha="$(git rev-parse HEAD)", result_summary="...")` |
| Team lead merges | Team lead | `git merge <task.branch>` locally — no remote fetch needed |
| Cleanup | Team lead | `team_dismiss` cleans up the agent's worktree |

Agents still push to origin as a safety net (crash recovery, inspection), but the merge path is purely local. Those safety-net publishes use explicit destination refspecs (`HEAD:refs/heads/<branch>` or `<branch>:refs/heads/<branch>`) so local upstream tracking cannot redirect them to the base/primary branch. The only PR in the workflow is the final goal-to-primary-branch PR for human review.

#### Multi-repo git handoff

In multi-repo projects, a single goal/session/staff worktree set spans multiple repos all sharing one branch name (`goal/<slug>-<id>`, `session-<slug>-<id>`, etc.). To track per-repo commit state, tasks carry a per-repo handoff map:

```typescript
// Multi-repo handoff (Phase 4):
task.gitHandoff: { [repoName]: { baseSha: string, headSha?: string, branch: string } }
```

The single-repo flat shape (`task.baseSha` / `task.headSha` / `task.branch` directly on the task) is preserved for back-compat — read helpers transparently project a single-repo task into the same shape so callers don't need to special-case mode.

Goal `git-status` and `git-diff` endpoints aggregate across all repos; the git-status widget shows per-repo collapsible sections. Cleanup tears down all per-repo worktrees and deletes all matching remote branches. PR/merge tooling (gh integration) operates per-repo; a multi-repo goal opens N PRs (one per repo with commits), all titled with the goal's branch.

Multi-repo invariant: all repos in a worktree set sit on the same branch name. There is no per-repo branch divergence within a goal.

Tasks and workflows are complementary layers:
- **Workflows** = quality layer (what gates to pass, in what order, with what verification)
- **Tasks** = operational layer (who's doing what, status tracking, assignment)

## Context injection

Context injection is the mechanism that feeds passed upstream gate content into agent prompts. This is how the design doc shapes the implementation, and the issue analysis feeds the reproducing test.

### At spawn time (`team_spawn`)

When spawning an agent via `team_spawn`, you can pass:

- **`workflowGateId`** (0 or 1) — declares which workflow gate the agent should produce output for. If `inputGateIds` is not set, the server auto-resolves inputs from the DAG's `dependsOn`.
- **`inputGateIds`** (0 or more) — explicit list of workflow gate IDs whose passed content to inject. Overrides automatic DAG resolution.

The resolved gate content is injected into the agent's **system prompt** under a `# Upstream Gates` section.

**Examples:**
```
# Auto-resolve from DAG (implementation depends on design-doc):
team_spawn(role="coder", task="Implement the fix", workflowGateId="implementation")

# Explicit inputs (reviewer needs more context than the formal DAG requires):
team_spawn(role="reviewer", task="Review the fix",
  workflowGateId="code-review",
  inputGateIds=["design-doc", "implementation", "test-results"])
```

### At prompt time (`team_prompt`)

When prompting an existing agent with new work via `team_prompt`, you can pass the same parameters:

- **`workflowGateId`** (optional) — what the agent should produce next
- **`inputGateIds`** (optional) — which gate content to inject as context

The resolved gate content is **prepended to the prompt message**, so the agent receives fresh context for the new task without needing to be respawned.

**Example:**
```

### On gate signal (`gate_signal`)

When signaling a gate, the server checks that all upstream dependencies have passed. If any upstream gate has not passed, the signal is rejected with a 409 response listing the missing dependency.

## How it all fits together

Here's the typical flow for a team goal with a workflow:

```
1. User creates a goal with workflowId="feature" (or any workflow defined on the project)
   → Server snapshots the workflow into the goal
   → Gate states initialized: design-doc=pending, implementation=pending, ready-to-merge=pending

2. Team Lead reads the workflow, sees the gate DAG:
   design-doc → implementation → ready-to-merge

3. Team Lead creates tasks linked to workflow gates:
   task_create(title="Write design doc", type="custom",
     workflowGateId="design-doc")

4. Team Lead spawns an agent with gate context:
   team_spawn(role="coder", task="Write design doc",
     workflowGateId="design-doc")
   → Agent gets the goal spec in its system prompt (no upstream deps for first gate)

5. Agent produces the design, pushes its branch, marks task complete.
   Team Lead merges the branch and signals the gate:
   gate_signal(gate_id="design-doc", content="# Design\n\n...")
   → Server runs verification (if configured) → gate status: passed
   (Only the team lead can call gate_signal — see "Signaling a gate" above.)

6. Team Lead spawns next agent with upstream context:
   team_spawn(role="coder", task="Implement the design",
     workflowGateId="implementation")
   → Agent receives the passed design-doc content in its system prompt

7. Agent completes implementation, pushes branch, marks task complete.
   Team Lead merges the branch and signals the gate:
   gate_signal(gate_id="implementation")
   → Verification runs (npm run check + LLM review) → gate status: passed

8. Process continues through the DAG until every gate is passed (or human-bypassed —
   a bypassed gate satisfies downstream dependency ordering like a passed one, but
   completion still requires explicit human confirmation; see step 9)

9. team_complete() — server verifies all workflow gates have passed.
   (If any gate was human-bypassed, team_complete is refused; a human must
   confirm via POST /api/goals/:id/team/complete { confirmBypassedGates: true }.
   See "Human gate bypass" above.)
```

## REST API reference

### Workflows

All mutations require `projectId` (400 otherwise). Reads without `projectId` return `[]` / 404. See [rest-api.md — Workflows](rest-api.md#workflows) for the full contract.

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/workflows?projectId=X` | List workflows for a project |
| `GET` | `/api/workflows/:id?projectId=X` | Get full workflow detail |
| `POST` | `/api/workflows?projectId=X` | Create a workflow |
| `PUT` | `/api/workflows/:id?projectId=X` | Update a workflow |
| `DELETE` | `/api/workflows/:id?projectId=X` | Delete (blocked if in-use by active goals) |
| `POST` | `/api/workflows/:id/clone?projectId=X` | Deep-copy a workflow with a new ID |

### Gates

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/goals/:id/gates` | List all gates for a goal with status and definitions |
| `GET` | `/api/goals/:id/gates/:gateId` | Get gate detail (status, signals, definition) |
| `GET` | `/api/goals/:id/gates/:gateId/inspect` | Scoped gate data retrieval — content, verification, or signal history |
| `POST` | `/api/goals/:id/gates/:gateId/signal` | Signal a gate — triggers verification |
| `POST` | `/api/goals/:id/gates/:gateId/reset` | Reset the gate plus transitive downstream dependents to pending |
| `GET` | `/api/goals/:id/gates/:gateId/signals` | Get signal history for a gate |
| `GET` | `/api/goals/:id/gates/:gateId/content` | Get the current passed content of a gate |
| `POST` | `/api/goals/:id/gates/:gateId/cancel-verification` | Cancel a stuck running verification (idempotent) |
| `GET` | `/api/goals/:id/verifications/active` | Get in-flight verification state (running steps, sessions) |

The gate list, gate detail, and task list endpoints support `?view=summary` for slim agent-facing responses. See [rest-api.md — Summary views](rest-api.md#summary-views-viewsummary) for response shapes, the [Gate reset endpoint](rest-api.md#gate-reset-endpoint) for reset response details, and the [Gate inspect endpoint](rest-api.md#gate-inspect-endpoint) for the `/inspect` endpoint.

### Tasks (gate-linked)

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/goals/:id/tasks` | Create task — accepts `workflowGateId` and `inputGateIds` |
| `PUT` | `/api/tasks/:id` | Update task — accepts `workflowGateId` and `inputGateIds` |

### Team (context injection)

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/goals/:id/team/spawn` | Spawn agent — `workflowGateId` + `inputGateIds` for context injection |
| `POST` | `/api/goals/:id/team/prompt` | Prompt agent — `workflowGateId` + `inputGateIds` prepended to message |

## Storage

State is per-project — each project has its own copies of these files in `<project-root>/.bobbit/state/`. The server aggregates across all projects via `ProjectContextManager`.

| Location | What |
|---|---|
| `defaults/workflows/*.yaml` | Workflow templates (repo-local, version controlled) |
| `<project>/.bobbit/state/goals.json` | Goals with snapshotted workflows (includes `projectId`) |
| `<project>/.bobbit/state/gates.json` | Gate state and signal history |
| `<project>/.bobbit/state/tasks.json` | Tasks with workflow gate links |
