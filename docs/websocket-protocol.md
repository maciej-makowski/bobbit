# WebSocket Protocol

Bobbit exposes two WebSocket entrypoints. Both require the first frame to be `auth` and close unauthenticated sockets.

## Endpoints

### Session sockets: `/ws/<session-id>`

Connect to `wss://<host>:<port>/ws/<session-id>`. First message must be `{ "type": "auth", "token": "<token>" }`. After `auth_ok`, the client can send session commands and receives streaming session events.

### Viewer sockets: `/ws/viewer`

The goal dashboard uses `wss://<host>:<port>/ws/viewer` when no agent session is active. First message is `{ "type": "auth", "token": "<token>", "goalId": "<optional-goal-id>" }`; the optional `goalId` seeds the viewer's goal-subscription set before `auth_ok`.

After `auth_ok`, a viewer socket is authenticated but not associated with a session and is not added to `SessionManager` clients. It accepts only viewer subscription messages and `ping`; messages outside that set have no effect.

Goal-scoped broadcasts (`gate_*`, `team_*`, `goal_*`) reach viewer sockets only when they are subscribed to the matching `goalId`. Session sockets for agents that belong to that goal still receive those same events. Search/index broadcasts (`index:*`) are project broadcasts rather than goal broadcasts, so they still reach authenticated viewer sockets regardless of goal subscription.

Session-list invalidations (`session_created`, `sessions_changed`, and `session_removed`) are global. The browser keeps a lightweight `/ws/viewer` connection open even when no session `RemoteAgent` is active, so desktop sidebars, mobile landing pages, and dashboards can refresh `GET /api/sessions` promptly instead of waiting for the periodic poll. Session sockets also handle the same invalidations for already-open chats. Treat these messages as refresh triggers only; the session list REST response remains the source of truth.

## Client → Server

| Type | Fields | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `auth` | `token`, `goalId?` | Authenticate the connection. `goalId` is only used by `/ws/viewer` to subscribe immediately after auth. |
| `subscribe_goal` | `goalId` | `/ws/viewer` only: add a goal subscription for goal-scoped broadcasts. |
| `unsubscribe_goal` | `goalId` | `/ws/viewer` only: remove one goal subscription. |
| `clear_goal_subscriptions` | — | `/ws/viewer` only: remove all goal subscriptions. |
| `prompt` | `text`, `images?`, `attachments?` | Send a user prompt |
| `steer` | `text` | Interrupt the agent mid-turn with guidance |
| `follow_up` | `text` | Send a follow-up message |
| `steer_queued` | `messageId` | Promote a queued message to steered (priority) |
| `remove_queued` | `messageId` | Remove a message from the queue |
| `reorder_queue` | `messageIds` | Reorder the prompt queue to match the given ID order |
| `abort` | — | Abort the current agent turn |
| `retry` | — | Retry the last failed turn |
| `set_model` | `provider`, `modelId` | Switch the AI model |
| `set_image_model` | `provider`, `modelId` | Switch the per-session image generation model. Server validates `(provider, modelId)` against `getAvailableImageModels()`; on unknown the server replies with `{ type: "error", message: "unknown image model", code: "UNKNOWN_IMAGE_MODEL" }` and does **not** mutate session state. On valid, persists `imageModelProvider`/`imageModelId` to the session row and broadcasts the updated state to all attached clients. |
| `compact` | — | Trigger context compaction |
| `get_state` | — | Request current agent state |
| `get_messages` | — | Request full message history |
| `set_title` | `title` | Set session title |
| `generate_title` | — | Auto-generate title from conversation |
| `resume` | `fromSeq` | Resume streaming after a reconnect — server replays only events with `seq > fromSeq` (see [Streaming resume](#streaming-resume)) |
| `ping` | — | Keepalive ping |
| `task_create` | `goalId`, `title`, `taskType`, `parentTaskId?`, `spec?`, `dependsOn?` | Create a task |
| `task_update` | `taskId`, `updates` | Update a task (title, spec, state, assignment, deps) |
| `task_delete` | `taskId` | Delete a task |
| `summarize_goal_title` | `goalTitle` | Auto-generate a shorter goal title |

## Server → Client

| Type | Key Fields | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `auth_ok` | — | Authentication succeeded |
| `auth_failed` | — | Authentication failed |
| `state` | `data` | Current agent state snapshot |
| `messages` | `data` | Full message history array |
| `event` | `data`, `seq?`, `ts?` | Streaming agent event (message_start, content_delta, tool calls, etc.). `seq` is a monotonic per-session counter starting at 1; `ts` is wall-clock ms at broadcast time. Both are optional for backward compatibility — old clients that ignore them still function correctly. |
| `resume_gap` | `lastSeq` | Server's reply to a `resume` whose `fromSeq` is older than the retained EventBuffer window. Client must fall back to `get_messages` for a fresh snapshot and reset its seq counter to `lastSeq`. |

| `session_title` | `sessionId`, `title` | Title changed |
| `session_created` | `sessionId`, `projectId?` | A visible session was created through REST, UI, or `host.agents`; clients should refresh the session list immediately. |
| `sessions_changed` | `projectId?` | Broad session-list invalidation fallback; clients should refresh the session list. |
| `session_removed` | `sessionId`, `projectId?`, `reason` | A session was terminated, archived, or purged; clients should remove or refresh the matching row promptly. |
| `client_joined` | `clientId` | Another client connected |
| `client_left` | `clientId` | A client disconnected |
| `error` | `message`, `code` | Error message |
| `pong` | — | Keepalive response |

| `queue_update` | `sessionId`, `queue` | Prompt queue changed |
| `side_panel_workspace` | `sessionId`, `workspace` | The server-authoritative side-panel workspace for the session changed. Clients replace their local mirror only when `workspace.revision` is newer; see [side-panel-workspace.md](side-panel-workspace.md). |
| `task_changed` | `task` | A task was created, updated, or deleted |
| `tasks_list` | `tasks` | Full task list for a goal |
| `session_archived` | `sessionId`, `archivedAt` | Session was archived |

| `gate_verification_awaiting_human` | `goalId`, `gateId`, `signalId`, `stepIndex`, `stepName`, `label`, `prompt` | A `human-signoff` step parked waiting on a human decision. Resolution emits `gate_verification_step_complete` (no separate event). See [goals-workflows-tasks.md — Human sign-off steps](goals-workflows-tasks.md#human-sign-off-steps). |
| `gate_verification_complete` | `goalId`, `gateId`, `signalId`, `status` | All verification steps finished |

| `inbox.entry.added` | `staffId`, `entry` | A new inbox entry was enqueued for a staff agent (trigger fire, `POST /api/staff/:id/inbox`, or UI "+ Add to inbox"). See [staff-inbox.md](staff-inbox.md). |
| `inbox.entry.updated` | `staffId`, `entry` | A staff agent transitioned an inbox entry via `inbox_complete` / `inbox_dismiss`. |
| `inbox.entry.removed` | `staffId`, `entryId` | An inbox entry was pruned (`DELETE /api/staff/:id/inbox/:entryId`). Entry body not echoed — clients reconcile by id. |

### Background process events

`BgProcessInfo` snapshots carry `{ id, name, command, pid, status, exitCode, terminalReason, startTime, endTime }`, where timestamps are epoch milliseconds. `status` is `"running" | "exited" | "unrecoverable"`. `exitCode` is `number | null`. `terminalReason` is `"normal" | "killed" | "unrecoverable" | null` (null while running). Running processes have `endTime: null`; exited processes set `endTime` once at child exit.

`bg_process_created` sends the full running snapshot. `bg_process_exited` sends `{ processId, exitCode, endTime, terminalReason }` so clients can update an existing pill without waiting for REST hydration: `terminalReason` distinguishes a clean exit (`"normal"`), a user-requested kill (`"killed"`), and a process whose real exit code could not be recovered after a gateway restart (`"unrecoverable"`); in the latter two cases `exitCode` is `null` and clients must not fabricate one. Missing legacy `endTime` values mean the final runtime is unknown; clients should keep the display non-growing rather than deriving elapsed time from `Date.now()`.

`bg_process_dismissed` (`{ processId }`) fires when a record is removed — either via explicit dismiss or as part of the legacy kill-then-dismiss path — and signals that the pill should disappear and its persisted log/status files have been purged. Dismiss is rejected (REST 409) while a process is still running; clients kill it first, then dismiss the resulting exited record.

### Session cost hydration

`cost_update.cost` has the same shape as `state.serverCost`: cumulative input/output/cache token totals plus `totalCost`, with `cacheHitRate` included by current servers. The payload is read from persisted `CostTracker` data and is not a delta; clients should replace their cached cost snapshot, not add it locally.

When persisted cost exists, the server hydrates it on active attach/reconnect, `get_state`, `get_messages`, resume/replay fallback, archived attach/state/messages, and `refreshAfterCompaction()`. `refreshAfterCompaction()` sends `cost_update` before the compacted `messages` snapshot so the UI keeps showing cumulative spend instead of recalculating from the reduced visible transcript.

See [session-cost.md](session-cost.md) for the source-of-truth and no-double-counting rules.

### Cost update shape

The `cost` field of a `cost_update` message:

```json
{
  "inputTokens": 12500,
  "outputTokens": 340,
  "cacheReadTokens": 87000,
  "cacheWriteTokens": 3200,
  "totalCost": 0.004712,
  "cacheHitRate": 0.874
}
```

- `cacheHitRate?: number | null` — derived ratio `cacheReadTokens / (cacheReadTokens + inputTokens)`. `null` when the denominator is 0 (cold session, or provider that does not report cache counters). Optional for mixed-version compatibility with older payloads.
- Older clients that do not recognise `cacheHitRate` silently ignore it.

See [docs/cache-hit-rate.md](cache-hit-rate.md) for formula details and null semantics.

### Streaming resume

Every `event` broadcast carries a server-assigned monotonic `seq` (per session, starting at 1) and wall-clock `ts`. The client tracks the highest `seq` it has seen and, on WebSocket reopen, sends `{ type: "resume", fromSeq: <highest> }` so the server replays only the tail it missed. If `fromSeq` is older than the oldest entry retained in the session's EventBuffer ring, the server replies `{ type: "resume_gap", lastSeq }` — the client then fetches a full snapshot via `get_messages` and resets its counter to `lastSeq`. This eliminates the duplicate/out-of-order frames that could appear during mid-stream reconnects. See [docs/internals.md — Event stream ordering & dedup](internals.md#event-stream-ordering--dedup) and [docs/design/streaming-dedup-reorder.md](design/streaming-dedup-reorder.md).

### Search index events

The `index:*` events drive the search status dot and the Settings → Maintenance → Search Index panel. They are never surfaced as foreground toasts or banners — users who want detail open the Maintenance panel. See [docs/internals.md — Semantic search](internals.md#semantic-search) for the full re-indexing model.
